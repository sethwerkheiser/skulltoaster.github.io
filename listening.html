		<strong>What&#039;s Brandon Duncan Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Thu, 05 Sep 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Brandon Duncan (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/expiringsun" target="_blank">@expiringsun</a>) is an illustrator, artist and musician. I met him through some random conversations on Twitter, and we started chatting, and now he's helping kick off this feature here at Skull Toaster. Be sure to check out his work at <a href="http://expiringsun.com/" target="_blank">Expiring Sun</a>.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Black Sabbath's</strong> 'Dehumanizer!' When I was in 4th or 5th grade, I was at the grocery store pharmacy with my mom. While we were waiting, I started looking through this rack of cassettes they had there. When I came across 'Dehumanizer' I couldn't stop staring at it. The artwork was quite intimidating to me, which was a thrill, and it totally made me think of The Terminator, which was totally bad ass! I remember very distinctly just looking at that cassette in that pharmacy for probably 15 or 20 minutes. At that point I was familiar with Black Sabbath, I grew up on rock and roll, but I had never heard THIS Black Sabbath, with Dio.<BR><BR>


		My mom bought the cassette for me, which was really awesome of her! When we got home and I popped it into my boombox, it didn't just give me chills, it absolutely fucking scared the hell out of me! When Dio's voice came in after those pounding drums and that opening riff, that was the most fucking terrifying and powerful thing I had ever heard! And god damn I loved it, haha! I was hooked, I felt like at that point I knew what my life was all about! It's still one of my all time favorite albums. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you love and should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		Oh man, fun question! I'd have to say <strong>Garbage's</strong> self titled debut. I'm a big fan of that album; it's catchy and poppy but also has a dark edge to it. It also reminds me of high school and simpler times in life! I am not ashamed to say that I really dig some alternative pop music when it's done well.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Album from this year that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		There has been so many great albums this year it's insane. I don't know what's going on but something is obviously in the air! If I had to pick one though, it would be '<a href="http://hellsheadbangers.bandcamp.com/album/henbane" target="_blank">Henbane</a>' from <strong>Cultes Des Ghoules</strong>. That album totally caught me off guard, I had never heard them before. <BR><BR>

		My friend Spencer (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/nudemutant" target="_blank">@nudemutant</a>) told me about it, he always has solid recommendations, so I gave it a listen while I was at work. And don't tell my boss, but I honestly didn't get any work done at all for an hour because my jaw was on the floor! I couldn't believe what I was hearing! It sounds like it is genuinely recorded by a coven of witches! The atmosphere, vocals and everything about it is astonishing. I love it!<BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Amy Sciarretto Listening To?</strong>
Thu, 12 Sep 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Writer and music industry vet Amy Sciarretto (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/lrgrrl666" target="_blank">@lrgrrl666</a>) has been at it for over 15 years. Her writing has appeared in Kerrang, Alternative Press, Guitar World, Decibel, Hit Parader, and she was the Loud Rock Editor at CMJ New Music Report for eight years. Amy was also lead blogger for Noise Creep, which she helped me launch back in 2009.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Far 'Water & Solutions.' It's perfection on record. I think Jonah (Matranga) co-wrote half the <strong>Deftones</strong> songs. Just listen to 'Water & Solutions' and you'll see what I mean. I have the set list from their last NYC show before they broke up (and eventually reunited) from Coney Island High. It's on an orange piece of paper. I collect set lists, actually. Have tons of 'em! <BR><BR>


		I was in college, getting ready to leave the nest and move to NYC for my job, and I just glommed on to that record. It's much slept on and overlooked. That's a shame, but it's still MORE MINE than anyone else's. I used to rescue copies out of used bins in record stores and give it to friends. It could not sit there for 99 cents. I NEEDED to share it with people.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's an album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Creed</strong>, 'My Own Prison.' Honestly, good, grungy rock and the title track has super powerful lyrics. I have seen them many times, from NYC's Madison Square Garden to Irving Plaza. I even have the set list (I collect them) from the Irving Plaza gig. I have interviewed them multiple times, both at the height of their fame in the late 1990s (yes, Scott Stapp was prickly) and when they had reunited. That interview took place in their PR firm's office in NYC, with me and the entire band in a conference room. They were super duper amenable to how ever much time I wanted, and they were gracious. Mark Tremonti was incredibly friendly and Stapp was super direct. Made eye contact, answered all my questions. It was a totally great experience, and for Noisecreep.<BR><BR>


		I think a lot of people look at Creed like <strong>Nickelback</strong> -- douche-rock that's easy to clown on. And it is. But there is a reason that the Middle American populace, in their Ford F150s and with their cases of Bud not far from their hands, love this music. It's regular guy rock. It's not too hard, and it's just hard enough. The lyrics are just deep enough to spark some sort of connection.<BR><BR>

		But Creed do it well. They take/took the elements of grunge that made that the genre du jour of the early 1990s and that which sounded the death knell for glam rock of the 1980s and put their own spin. (Another reason <strong>Bon Jovi</strong> survived that -- because they were so good at what they did, and were able to make semi-country songs and accessible rock songs beyond the '80s hairspray rock! New Jersey for life. DO NOT come at me about Jovi, brah! I will defend my fellow NJers till the death!)<BR><BR>

		I think that the fact that Scott Stapp discovered rock through his own band also resonates with fans. It was like an awakening. Plus, his lyrics to 'My Own Prison' were not douchey, at all.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What are you listening to this year that's blown you away?</strong><BR><BR>

		Ok, this is not metal but I love <strong>Lorde's</strong> 'Royals' and cannot wait to hear the whole album. This girl is 16 and sounds like <strong>Adele</strong>. But her lyrics are amazing on this song and it can be applied to being a metal fan; "We crave a different kind of buzz."<BR><BR>

		I just got <strong>NIN</strong> 'Hesitation Marks,' too. Love what I hear so far, and not just for nostalgic purposes. The new <strong>Devil Wears Prada</strong> is pretty vicious, too. And the new <strong>Killswitch Engage</strong>.<BR><BR>

						<strong>What&#039;s John Sturm Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Fri, 20 Sep 2013<BR><BR>


		<em>The whole point of this recurring feature is to explore how we all came to metal, to briefly explain our musical journey. With that, I'm stoked to feature fellow metal trivia nerd John Sturm (<a href="https://twitter.com/mrjohnsturm" target="_blank">@mrjohnsturm</a>). He's a school librarian in England by day, and "<a href="http://echoesanddust.com/2013/03/john-sturm/" target="_blank">by night a tired father and husband</a>." John also writes reviews for the mighty <a href="http://echoesanddust.com/tag/john-sturm/" target="_blank">Echoes and Dust</a>.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		‘Load’ by <strong>Metallica</strong>. There are a multitude of reasons for this choice that kinda form a big web really. <BR><BR>


		I was 15 when this album came out. I formed a band and Metallica were our idols. This was the first album of theirs that was “my” album. The album I had waited for, and poured over every interview in magazines for information about. It is tied in to a time in my life where I was beginning to express myself more openly both in face-to-face conversation and through my lyrics in my band. When I finally got 'Load' and heard the mighty James Hetfield pour his heart out onto his lyrics; to be open and honest and heartfelt just blew my mind; if he could do it - this icon of metal strength - then, so could I. <BR><BR>

		Musically I loved it too. Still do. It was Metallica, letting loose, trying different things and being brave enough to not give a shit what people wanted but to follow their convictions and do what THEY wanted. It's a lesson I think that still holds true to this day. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's some music you should be embarrassed to listen to but you totally aren't?</strong><BR><BR>

		This is a tough one. I do love musicals and have a number of soundtracks, so pick one; Guys & Dolls, Blood Brothers, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Gondoliers... HA! <BR><BR>


		I’m never embarrassed by any of the music I listen to, simply because as Paul Stanley once said, "There are only two types of music in the world: music you like and music you don’t like." Styles, genres, sun-genres mean nothing to me really - if it’s a good tune it’s a good tune. If you like it? Cool! If you don’t? Cool!<BR><BR>

		<strong>Name an album that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		Without a doubt ‘Emergence’ by <strong>Neuronspoiler</strong>. I’d heard nothing of this band, not one single note, so when I picked it off the submissions list for <a href="http://echoesanddust.com/" target="_blank">Echoes & Dust</a> I’d only read the press release. Holy balls, I was blown away. <BR><BR>

		It’s a blend of <strong>Iron Maiden</strong>, <strong>Helloween</strong>, <strong>Judas Priest</strong> and shades of Metallica. It's melodic, heavy and FUN!! I love, love, LOVE this album. Still listening to it to this day. One of the best albums of 2013.<BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Zareen Price Listening To?</strong><BR>
Thu, 26 Sep 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Zareen Price (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/dakinilaughter " target="_blank">@dakinilaughter</a>) talks a bit about her journey of heavy metal. Zareen runs <a href="http://milamrecords.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Milam Records</a>, and she's the founding editor of the black metal theory journal, <a href="http://helvetejournal.org/" target="_blank">Helvete</a>. On top of that, <a href="http://dakinilaughter.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dawa Drolma</a> is a collection of the music Zareen writes and records.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		When I was 16 years old, I was working an embarrassing retail job in Escondido's North County Fair shopping mall, and I was just discovering extreme metal in high school with the help of a friend's DSL connection. He had recently given me a CDR filled with lots of great stuff - <strong>maudlin of the Well's</strong> 'Bath' and 'Leaving Your Body Map,' 'Sounds of Pain' by <strong>Uaral</strong>, Transilvanian fucking Hunger, so I was getting to the point that I could recognize these extreme albums on sight. <BR><BR>


		Anyways, I usually passed my work breaks spending my paycheck at the Sam Goody three stores down from mine. I really went with my gut most of the time. During one of these breaks, luck put <strong>Emperor's</strong> 'In The Nightside Eclipse' in my path. The Tolkien-inspired art reminded me of <strong>Blind Guardian</strong> ("Niiiiightfaaaaaaaall!"), so I snatched it up. It was the first black metal record I ever bought, although I didn't realize it at the time. I put it in my CD player as soon as I got home, and I was immediately overwhelmed by that beautiful, buzzing din. I cried listening to it that first time.<BR><BR>

		I remember being scared to play the track 'Inno a Satana,' though, because I thought it was too demonic. Turns out my parents agreed, because while I was out one day, my mom and some of her friends exorcised my room. Apparently, somewhere in between speaking in tongues at all of my belongings and anointing my bed with oil and holy water, the Holy Spirit directed them to look through my CD collection. You can probably guess what happened to the CD. But don't worry, the part of me that is still an asshole teenager regularly has her revenge: I always crank the volume to 11 when the needle hits 'Inno a Satana' now.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Name an old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		My undying love for Blind Guardian aside, one of the more offbeat (by metal standards) albums I love is 'Just a Souvenir' by <strong>Squarepusher</strong>. <BR><BR>


		I was introduced to Squarepusher in 2006 by a composition major who lived across the hall from me during my first year at university, and I remember being captivated by an interview of this bizarre recluse yammering about the computer being a co-creator, as though it had some artistic agency. It sounded like some of the philosophy I was reading at the time - which in turn sounded like science fiction - but I'd never heard anything like it seriously applied to something so practical as music. At the end of the interview, he improvised a bit on his bass. The guy's truly a virtuoso. While I can see how some of his ideas and sound may seem corny, I've never really been embarrassed listening to him. I think this is in part because I was fortunate to receive a grounding in jazz and avant music concurrent with my metal education, so the two are intertwined in my memory. I also recognize that metal has its own set of eccentricities and recycled tropes that seem at least as ridiculous to scene outsiders as Squarepusher seems to metalheads.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from 2013 that will for sure end up on your year end list.</strong><BR><BR>

		If I manage not to type "ANTEDILUVIAN LOGOS" on all ten lines this year, it'll be a minor miracle.<BR><BR>

		Widening the scope a bit, '<a href="http://wrmlst.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">The Feral Wisdom</a>' by <strong>Wormlust</strong> is definitely on my top 10 list. I couldn't believe I'd never heard them when a friend tweeted a link to their Bandcamp late last year, and I've been anxiously anticipating this album's release ever since. It's my favorite flavor of poison: bad trip psychedelia blended with bitterly oppressive black metal that brings all the atmosphere without skimping on heaviness. The cover art's bonkers, too, like something out of a Wonka-run haunted house. All in all, I consider it an affirmative example of atmospheric black metal's ongoing vitality.<BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Jeremiah Nelson Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Wed, 02 Oct 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Jeremiah Nelson (<a href="https://twitter.com/V3RDICT" target="_blank">@V3RDICT</a>) has been a Skull Toaster metal trivia master for quite awhile now, at least for over a year or so, answering questions with skill and sharing in NFL misery as a Bills fan (as I'm a Raiders fan).</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		There are two albums that immediately come to mind. <strong>Deftones</strong>' 'White Pony' and <strong>Zao's</strong> 'Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest.' 'Blood and Fire Bring Rest' came out in '98, 'White Pony' came out in 2000. I got my driver's license in 1999 and spent most of the summer of 2000 driving around with my girlfriend (now wife) listening to those two albums on repeat. Also, 'Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest' came out right after I got my first guitar. There were many hours spent with my best friend and first band-mate, learning to plays those Zao riffs.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by, but you're not ?</strong><BR><BR>

		Haha, oh boy. I'm sure I could dig up several of these albums. <strong>Korn's</strong> 'Follow the Leader' is one of them. It's the first Korn album that I heard. I was 15 when it came out, developing my musical tastes. It was stepping stone to heavier things. I got it from a friend in my karate class. He burned me a copy, complete with scrawled, black Sharpie title. My buddy gave it to me in September of '98. In October that year we had a national karate tournament in Atlanta, GA and played the album non-stop, that whole trip. 'Dead Bodies Everywhere' was our theme song as we kicked ass at that karate tournament. I finished second.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from this year that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		This is tough. 2013 has already been an awesome year for metal. New <strong>Amon Amarth</strong>, <strong>Gorguts</strong>, <strong>All Pigs Must Die</strong>, <strong>Howl</strong>, <strong>Mumakil</strong>, <strong>Inter Arma</strong>. Take your pick, they're all fantastic. <BR><BR>

		One of my favorites this year is <strong>Nails</strong> 'Abandon All Life.' So pissed off. Definitely Top 10. I listened to it just about every day for a month after it came out. I still pull it out once a week or so. I've talked about the album and listened to it with friends here in Richmond, VA. Even had a couple of Twitter conversations with Collin Simula about it.<BR><BR>

			======================================================<BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Jaci Raia Listening To?</strong><BR>
Thu, 10 Oct 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Jaci Raia (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jaci_KVLT" target="_blank">@jaci_KVLT</a>) is an <a href="http://kvlt.co/" target="_blank">accomplished art director</a> living in New York City. She is into "world travel, sunshine, bourbon whiskey" (among other things) and, as you'll read below, a varied bunch of music.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's that one album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Not necessarily an album but more a specific song. I was somewhere around 9 or 10, in the car with my dad and brother driving somewhere mundane. I remember hearing <strong>Blue Öyster Cult</strong>, '(Don't Fear) The Reaper' and loudly proclaiming from the back seat that it was my FAVORITE SONG. Something about the hypnotizing guitar melody, the vocals, the lyrics, the part about halfway through where it gets all dark and evil-sounding. It still gives me chills to this day. Every time. Driving around in the car with my parents listening to classic rock for years definitely gave me a taste for heavier stuff, which definitely factors into what I listen to today.<BR><BR>

		<strong>An album that you should be embarrassed about but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		Absolutely, 100%, hands down: <strong>DragonForce</strong>, 'Sonic Firestorm.' I will always feel like kind of an asshole for admitting that I love this band, but I do. Wholeheartedly. The first time I heard it I cracked up through the entire five minutes of the first song. Then... I kept listening. It's absolutely ridiculous power metal cheese in every single way but it makes me so fucking happy. The sun is shining when 'My Spirit Will Go On"' is playing.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What have you heard this year that'll make your year end list?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>The Ruins of Beverast</strong>, 'Blood Vaults.' It's been a time since Meilenwald put out anything new, and I listen to '<a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/The_Ruins_of_Beverast/Foulest_Semen_of_a_Sheltered_Elite/247209" target="_blank">Foulest Semen of a Sheltered Elite</a>' constantly. I was expecting the new album to be incredible, and it delivered. I am a huge sucker for any type of black metal that can be described as "vast" and "epic", and 'Blood Vaults' has that in spades.<BR><BR>

						<strong>What&#039;s Laina Dawes Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 15 Oct 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Laina Dawes (<a href="https://twitter.com/Lainad" target="_blank">@Lainad</a>), author of 'What Are You Doing Here?', is <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/event-tour-for-what-are-you-doing-here" target="_blank">crowd funding a North American book tour</a> to "discuss and black women's experiences in the metal, hardcore and punk scenes." Laina is a wonderful person who I got to meet recently in New York City; passionate and brimming with awesome! If you can, please <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/event-tour-for-what-are-you-doing-here" target="_blank">support her upcoming tour</a>.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		My first reaction would be <strong>Judas Priest's</strong> 'Screaming for Vengeance' as I knew I was a metal lifer after discovering that album at 11 or 12. However in hindsight I'd have to say that 'Sad Wings of Destiny' was more influential, simply because 'Victim of Changes' is my favorite song of all time.<BR><BR>


		Really listening to Rob Halford's voice, really appreciating his talent, and this album really made me think about the genre. It sounds kinda strange but I started tearing that album apart in my mind, thinking about the solos; the groove and the interplay between K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton. There were things about the technical aspects of metal and the song itself that made me think about how the music was put together and the lyrical content and I think that really inspired me to want to write about metal when I was an adult.<BR><BR> 

		<strong>An older album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		Hmm. I'd have to say 'Theatre of Pain' by <strong>Motley Crue</strong>.<BR><BR> 
			
		It's not a bad, <em>bad</em> album, per se, but it really signified the beginning of the end for that band. Oh and for a single, I'd have to say <strong>Ice Cube's</strong> 'You Can Do It (Get Your Back Into It).' 'Theatre of Pain' still has that hungry, raw, thrash feel to it, ala 'Shout at the Devil' but the ballad 'Home Sweet Home' is cheesy fun.<BR><BR> 

		<strong>Album from this year that will end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Windhand's</strong> 'Soma' really caught me by surprise. In some ways, it is simply a great album but there are no special flourishes or anything, but for some reason it really resonated with me.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Kyle Unzicker Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 22 Oct 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Kyle Unzicker (<a href="https://twitter.com/kyle_unzicker">@kyle_unzicker</a>), one of the early followers of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/skulltoaster" target="_blank">@skulltoaster</a>, is a designer, developer, and metal fan. He sports a fine mustache and enjoys the following quality metal selections.</em><BR><BR> 

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Definitely <strong>Zao's</strong> 'Self-Titled' record. It usually doesn't rank near the top of Zao records by their fans, and band members themselves have gone on record saying they absolutely hate the electronic drums used on the record, but it's actually part of the reason I love it. The album is dark and pissed, and the electronic drums give a bit of an industrial sound on top it. <BR><BR>

		It was also huge for me personally - I would put on headphones and drum along and basically learned how to use a double bass pedal by playing along to 'Trashcanhands' over and over (or trying, anyway). On top of that, the packaging art enthralled me so much that it inspired me to pursue art and design which I'm lucky enough to do full-time now. Basically, this album rules my life. I'm listening to it now!<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		Amy Sciarretto's <a href="http://www.skulltoaster.com/2013/09/12/what-is-amy-sciarretto-listening-to/">answer of <strong>Creed's</strong> 'My Own Prison'</a> is such a fantastic answer, and one I would give myself, but if I have to choose another one, an easy choice would be <strong>Linkin Park's</strong> 'Hybrid Theory.' Rap metal and nu metal were definitely my gateway into other forms of metal and Linkin Park was a great introduction. Linkin Park was blue collar (I mean, come on, they all wore XXL work shirts in the liner photos) - <strong>Korn</strong> was dog collar and <strong>Limp Bizkit</strong> was popped collar - and Mike can actually rap. What makes me still love this album is how many different sounds they incorporate into it - turntables, piano, and a lot of electronica elements. Plus, everyone reading this has to admit that they loved singing along to "SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!!!"<BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from this year that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		The album 'Angst' by <strong>Hybrid</strong> absolutely blew me away. They are an experimental metal band from Spain that have been around for a bit but this was my first exposure to them. I started listening and was immediately reminded of <strong>Converge</strong>, <strong>The Ocean</strong> and <strong>Into the Moat</strong>, all in the same song. About halfway through the album, or when I encountered the clarinet solo, whichever came first, I couldn't wait to finish so I could start all over again. Top 10 for sure, probably top three.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Ozzy Osbourne's</strong> 'Blizzard of Ozz' never fails to blow my mind. I had recently got into Ozzy Osbourne after purchasing his 'Down To Earth' album (which was just released at the time I discovered the Ozzman). I wanted to hear more of his music so I bought 'Blizzard of Ozz' at a Best Buy. From then on I was hooked, he's been my favorite since the tender age of 13.<BR><BR> 


		<strong>Name an old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		I can't think of any album in particular, but I did always get crap from my friends for being a fan of <strong>Kittie</strong>. I've been told they aren't "metal" and got made fun of whenever I wore their band shirts. I've never felt guilty about liking that band, been a huge fan of them since I was 13 and still am! <BR><BR>


		<strong>What album from this year will end up on your Top 10 for 2013?</strong> <BR><BR>

		Most definitely <strong>Carcass</strong> 'Surgical Steel' and <strong>Amon Amarth</strong> 'Deceiver Of The Gods.' I knew those albums were gonna blow my mind before I listened to them. Those two bands never disappoint.

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		Crash Test Dummies 'God Shuffled His Feet.' Not embarrassed because it's a good album!<BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from this year that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		Oh, there are a few. The biggest surprise for me is probably the self-titled <strong>Extol</strong> album. I had no idea it was coming out and with it being the band's first release in almost 10 years, it was a pleasant surprise. <BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Steff Vogeler Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 12 Nov 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Steff Vogeler (<a href="https://twitter.com/Doomnomad" target="_blank">@Doomnomad</a>) has been following @skulltoaster for awhile now, and every now and again we swap stories of traveling, or all the music we can't keep up with. Today I'm stoked to offer up the music that Steff has been listening to for the past few years!</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's one album that, after all these years, still gives you the chills?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Cursed</strong>, 'One.' Having grown up with nothing but punk rock, thinking metal was 'for long-haired <strong>Scorpions</strong> worshippers' and unaware of hardcore other than <strong>Black Flag</strong>, I hit somewhat of a musical existential crisis in my late teens. Everything was bland and repetitive, Fat Wreck formula regurgitated. That was, until a friend handed me a mix-tape without the track-list. <BR><BR>

		Amongst a number of early East Coast hardcore tracks he'd hidden <strong>Cursed's</strong> '1974.' It punched me square in the teeth. Not only was this faster, heavier and yet more melodic than anything I'd ever heard- it was RAW. That one song sealed the deal and I completely immersed myself in <strong>Cursed's</strong> discography, falling in love with the dystopian lyrics and instantly recognizable artwork. It was through them that I got into grind and crust- and further down the line I discovered metal didn't have to be all hairspray and bullet belts, either. I was fortunate enough to have seen them live and upon the release of 'Architects of Troubled Sleep', I rode my bike over the dutch border, some 300 km total, to get the vinyl on the day of its release. Madness. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Name an album you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Venerea</strong>, 'Shake Your (Swollen) Booty.' To me, this is the best "worst album" in existence. <BR><BR>

		Listening to this inevitable evokes a montage of my teenage years spent on lake shores and in parks, drinking horrible beer mixtures and trying to mosh harder than the boys (and failing miserably). Back then, this mind-melting combo of skate punk, eyesore artwork and excessive group-chanting was the epitome of awesome. Almost a decade-and-a-half later, I still know every word and the timing for each wooohooo. And let's be honest, you can't NOT chime in when 'Love is a battlefield of wounded hearts' gets butchered by these lovable Swedish bundles of hysteric energy. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's an album from 2013 that will be on your year end list?</strong><BR><BR>

		As I spent most of 2012 on the road, I'm still trying to catch up with last year's releases. My to-do list for more recent albums is so long I am actually terrified by it; I'm sure it's grown sharp claws and is dripping acid from its yellowed fangs by now. I certainly don't envy my review writing friends' attempts to write AOTY lists this winter. Too much has happened, all of my favorite genres seem to have seen a bit (or a lot) of a resurgence.<BR><BR>

		To pick only one LP that saw the light of day this year, I'd have to go with <strong>Jucifer's</strong> Russian Album. They're one of my favorite bands, admirable humans and outstanding musicians. 'за волгой для нас земли нет' had me reading up on Russian history and renewed my desire to travel there. Other honorable mentions include <strong>Meth Drinker</strong>, <strong>Uzala</strong>, <strong>Seven Sisters Of Sleep</strong>, <strong>Chelsea Wolfe</strong> and <strong>Russian Circles</strong>. And <strong>Nails</strong>. And <strong>Black Boned Angel</strong>. And <strong>KEN Mode</strong>. I should stop. And breathe. Breathing sounds good.<BR><BR>

			<strong>What&#039;s Collin Simula Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 18 Nov 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Collin Simula (<a href="https://twitter.com/CollinSimula">@CollinSimula</a>), from Columbus OH, played drums in <strong>Symphony in Peril</strong>, and has since been writing and recording music as <strong><a href="http://maranathaisheavy.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Maranatha</a></strong> since early 2012. I met Collin and his wife earlier this year, and they're some cool cats. He's also one of the few who've participated in the Skull Toaster metal trivia nights on Google+ Hangouts.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>Name an album that still gives you the chills after all these years.</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Living Sacrifice</strong> 'The Hammering Process.' I was in high school, a junior I think. All of my friends were listening to ska and pop punk, and I was listening to everything from nu-metal to heavier bands like <strong>Pantera</strong> and <strong>Prong</strong>. I had 'Reborn,' the previous Living Sacrifice album, but 'The Hammering Process' just locked it in for me.<BR><BR>

		The <strong>Sepultura</strong> meets <strong>Meshuggah</strong> sound was ahead of its time in the metalcore world and the record was just technical enough while staying groove-oriented and accessible.<BR><BR>

		I also loved that for a Christian band the lyrics were more metaphoric or poetic or whatever, not just cheesy Christian language. It was cool to see them start to garner some respect outside of the Christian world, and in turn getting more respect for Christian or semi-Christian heavy music in general. I remember Jamey Jasta from <strong>Hatebreed</strong> talking about how much he loved them.<BR><BR>

		The breakdown in 'Local Vengeance Killing' after he says "BRACE YOURSELF LIKE A MAN!" is still probably my favorite breakdown ever. Perfect lyrics-plus-music punch in the face. <BR><BR>

		<strong>How about an old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Korn's</strong> first record. I was just thinking last week about how I've officially gotten past the point of feeling embarrassed while listening to it (although I gave their new one a spin and admittedly switched Spotify to "private session"). Stupid lyrics and ridiculous vocals aside, it's a heavy album. Like, really heavy. They played in A. No one was playing in A then.<BR><BR>

		Regardless of one's thoughts on Korn or nu-metal in general, there's something to be said about a record that spawned an entire genre of heavy music. Some people take issue with that, feeling like nu-metal is a genre that should have never existed in the first place. I hate to break it to you, but scenester deathcore bands or even some late 90s hardcore would have never existed if it weren't for Korn.<BR><BR>

		And as far as the lyrics go, they helped bring metal to a much more personal, intimate place. Metal bands were talking about dragons or satan or politics or gore or whatever. Yeah, Jonathan Davis' personal demons may have been a little over the top at points but there was something fresh and new and intimate about a record ending with the vocalist literally crying because of the catharsis of his lyrics.<BR><BR>

		How about THAT for over-analyzing a nu-metal record?!<BR><BR>

		<strong>What albums from this year will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013?</strong><BR><BR>

		First, <strong>Nails</strong> 'Abandon All Life.' This is topping most people's end of year lists, I'm sure. It's something like 17 or 18 minutes long and it is a constant pummeling from start to finish. Some people would be pissed that they called it a full-length. But I feel worn out and bludgeoned after listening to it. I can't imagine more of it. I'd call that a full-length. It's been a while since I've heard a record sound that realistically pissed-off. Did I expect it to slay? Yes. And it exceeded that expectation.<BR><BR>

		Second, <strong>Carcass</strong> 'Surgical Steel.' I'm no Carcass mega-fan or anything. I respected their place in metal history and listened to them from time to time but I was never bonkers over them. So when I found out they were reforming and putting out a record, I yawned and assumed it was going to sound like a bunch of old guys trying to relive the glory days. But then I heard 'Captive Bolt Pistol,' the first track they released. This record sets the bar so high for death metal in 2013 it's ridiculous. The last death metal record that really blew me away like that was <strong>Decapitated's</strong> 'Organic Hallucinosis.' And if you know how good and cutting-edge that record is you know what I'm talking about here. This record is truly going to go down as one of the great death metal records of the last 20 years.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Cheryl Carter Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Wed, 27 Nov 2013<BR><BR>

		<em>Cheryl Carter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Cheryl_Prime" target="_blank">@Cheryl_Prime</a>) writes for various outlets like Metal Hammer, Scene Point Blank, Cvlt Nation, This Is Not A Scene, Subterranea Magazine, and her own blog, <a href="http://cherylprime.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Bleak Metal</a>. </em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		I think, despite not really listening to it much at all anymore, it's got to be <strong>Metallica's</strong> 'Ride the Lightning.' I was slowly getting into metal around 13 years old and it was really this record that showed me that rock music wasn't all about super fast riffs or some bloke shouting as loud as possible. The song that really got to me was 'Fade to Black.' There's so much emotion and honesty in that track and as a kid you're constantly looking for something that speaks to you and connects you to the things that you like, and this was it for me.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		Y'know, one of my all-time favourite bands is <strong>AFI</strong> and I guess at nearly thirty years old, people think I should have grown out of that group by now. So probably anything by them, or <strong>HIM</strong>. I make no apologies for anything that I enjoy. If a record truly bangs, then I'm into it. Although I will judge someone else's taste and often give looks of disbelief when friends say they're into certain things, so I should probably shut up? <BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from this year that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		Oh man, there's so much that will definitely end up on this list. I just had to submit my top 20 to Metal Hammer and within an hour of sending it in I received a record that changed everything. Unfortunately that meant losing something off there that I really loved, but the new <strong>Falkenbach</strong>, '<a href="http://en.prophecy.de/falkenbach-asa.html" target="_blank">(Asa)</a>' really struck me and sadly, something had to give. <BR><BR>

		It's been a really wonderful year for music so luckily things that I was excited about have really delivered. I'll probably end up doing a few different lists for a different places but mainstays are <strong>Deafheaven</strong>, 'Sunbather,' <strong>Altar of Plagues</strong>, 'Teethed Glory and Injury,' and <strong>Darkthrone</strong>, 'The Underground Resistance.' I love those three in particular for many different reasons and feelings, and they all bring the things I enjoy about metal right to the fore - the experimentation, the bravery, the pure unadulterated joy of the music - they're all bands performing at their peak and in two of the cases at least, bands that are going to continue to move forward for the foreseeable future and that's exciting.<BR><BR>

		Outside of metal, a few things that may end up on my Scene Point Blank all-genres list are: <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, 'ArtPop,' <strong>Vatican Shadow</strong>, 'Remember Your Black Day,' <strong>VNV Nation</strong>, 'Transnational,' and <strong>The National</strong>, 'Trouble Will Find Me.' I'll also add to my non-metal listening <strong>London Grammar</strong>, 'If You Wait' and <strong>Charles Bradley</strong>, 'Victim of Love.'<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Alex Kenis Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 02 Dec 2013 <BR><BR>

		<em>I met Alex Kenis (<a href="https://twitter.com/AlexKenis" target="_blank">@AlexKenis</a>) in the late 90s, when he played in <strong>Crutch</strong> (and then became <strong>Aletheian</strong>). Earlier this year he began work on a new project called <strong>Solamors</strong> (along with Jason Wisdom from <strong>Becoming the Archetype</strong> and Travis Turner of Aletheian, <strong>Unteachers</strong>, <strong>A Curio Vis</strong>), with an album, '<a href="http://solamors.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Depravity's Demise</a>,' due out Dec 24 of this year, and it slays.</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		There are a lot of options here, but I would probably say 'The Downward Spiral' from <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>.  Considering how lewd, violent and heretical certain tracks are... I feel a bit awkward mentioning it, and I don’t support those themes and still have to skip some of the songs, BUT I would occasionally suffer from bouts of depression, and Trent Reznor’s angst and disillusionment really came through in that recording, and gave me a musical shoulder to lean on that I couldn’t find anywhere else back in the 90’s.  <BR><BR>

		I understand that it might sound odd to think of listening to dark and depressed music as being an uplifting experience when you are yourself in the dumps, but it used to give me the sense that I was not alone, and that what I was feeling was a common human state.  And importantly; it didn’t try to cheer me up, get me to go outside, or tell me that everything would be alright... which are the most annoying things you can do to someone when they are depressed.  <BR><BR>

		One of the wonderful things about music is that music is always there when you need it to be there, to empathize, and to help you through.  Also, tracks like 'March of the Pigs' and 'The Becoming' fed my little budding-prog-musician mind the wacky meter changes that I was craving at the time.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Name an old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		I would probably say 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'  Just go listen to that title track if you have not heard it before.  I am not particularly a fan of hip-hop, soul, or vocal-centric-music, and it is definitely a bit embarrassing for a death-metal guy to jam out to that kind of thing... BUT her voice a blend of training and raw soul that grabs me on a level somewhere between physical and emotional.  To date: <strong>Lauren Hill</strong>, <strong>Cynic</strong> and <strong>Bach</strong> are the three artists that have succeeded in bringing me to tears with no context: just by merit of music/voice alone.<BR><BR>

		I also like friction and introspection, and the content is a sometimes dichotomous blend of frustration/hopefulness, indignation/thankfulness, as well interacting with concepts of injustice and inequality, while trying to put that into the perspective of religious belief and current (or current in the 90’s) social conditions.  I like when you can hear an artist actually interacting with a subject, or riffing on an aspect of it, and being strong in their beliefs about it but without just hitting you on the head with their opinions.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from this year that'll end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		Chris Keeney (old friend and occasional guitarist/hitman for Aletheian) turned me onto a band of some former students of his called <strong>Black Crown Initiate</strong>.  They put out an EP that is just amazing.  That took me by surprise.  It is just an EP though, so I’ll add that the new <strong>Extol</strong> album is absolutely killer too, but I expected that to be mind-blowing, so no surprise when it was.<BR><BR>

		What is Natalie Zina Walschots Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 09 Dec 2013 <BR><BR>

		<em>When Natalie Zina Walschots (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/NatalieZed" target="_blank">@NatalieZed</a>) isn't writing the most entertaining <a href="https://twitter.com/NatalieZed/status/406975271481651200" target="_blank">Tweets from metal shows</a>, she's keeping busy writing for outlets like National Post, HuffPost Music Canada, About Heavy Metal, and Exclaim!. She's also penned two books of poetry, one of which, 'DOOM: Love Poems for Supervillains,' which we gave away <a href="http://www.skulltoaster.com/2012/08/20/doom-love-poems-for-supervillains-give-away/" target="_blank">back in 2012</a>!</em> <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		The one record that gives me the feels every single time, without fail, is the self-titled <strong>Strapping Young Lad</strong> record from 2003. <BR><BR>

		This is arguably not their best record, objectively, but it's impossible for me to listen to 'Consequence' or 'Rape Song' without feeling my heart turn inside out. But it's 'Bring On The Young' that slays me every time: Townsend's voice, at first so gentle and almost pleading, the slow burning build of the song beginning as a throb -- and then it becomes all curdled, frustrated aggression, acidic and damning. My hair is standing up writing about it.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Do you love an old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not?</strong><BR><BR>

		For me, this is definitely Slipknot, 'S/T.' I'm not embarrassed for a couple of reasons: first and foremost, I am pretty sure I lack that thing in my brain that tells me I should be embarrassed or ashamed of things, which lets me happily enjoy all manner of things. Also, I don't even care, 'Wait and Bleed,' 'Scissors,' and 'Spit It Out' are ridiculously good, fun songs. Slipknot were one of the bands I listened to before my true metal awakening in my mid-twenties, and were responsible for helping me cultivate a taste for heavier things.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Album from this year that will for sure end up on your Top 10 for 2013.</strong><BR><BR>

		'Surgical Steel' by <strong>Carcass</strong>. 'Heartwork' is one of those albums that can wreck me every time I listen to it, and I was a little nervous approaching new material by a band that I love so desperately, especially after they have been quiet so long. <BR><BR>

		Seeing them perform as Maryland Deathfest last year assuaged some of my fears, as they sounded absolutely fantastic with the new lineup, but the construction of the record could have been something entirely different. When I first heart 'Surgical Steel,' all my trepidation was washed away. It's thunderous, triumphant, authentic, and utterly satisfying. It has all the ferocity of Carcass' early work with the impeccably songwriting of their later output (setting 'Swan Song' aside). Surgica Steel surprised me in the best way possible.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What is Josh King Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Thu, 19 Dec 2013<BR><BR>

		Joshua King (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/BurningPalaces" target="_blank">@BurningPalaces</a>) used to play bass in <strong><a href="http://rd.io/x/QEZ0PkGtIA/" target="_blank">Narcissus</a></strong>, and he's still playing music all these years later. He's been a regular here on Skull Toaster for awhile now, and lately he's been helping out with editing and fact-checking the metal trivia on a weekly basis. <BR><BR>

		<strong>One album that still gives you the chills after all these years.</strong><BR><BR>

		This was an absolute no-brainer for me; <strong>Cynic</strong>, 'Focus.' I remember everything about the first time I heard this album; where I was, what time of day, what I had for breakfast that morning, you get the idea. It was 1998 and I was a late-comer to the Cynic party. I spent a good deal of time while not in class, in the computer labs chatting in a metal channel chat on IRC. Someone told me I HAD to check them out.<BR><BR>

		Until that point, I think I had music divided into very neat, concise, defined compartments of understanding. Metal had subgenres but they were each written from a very metal viewpoint. 'Focus' took that and turned it on its ear for me, so to speak. All of a sudden, it seemed as though there were no "rules" as to what you could and couldn't do with metal.<BR><BR>

		It's jazz. It's prog. It's death metal. It has tons of vocoded vocals. It's definitely not for everyone, but it changed my musical life because it made me realize that metal didn't have to be JUST metal. It could be EVERYTHING.<BR><BR>

		<strong>How about an album that you're supposed to be embarrased by but you're not?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Danzig</strong>, 'S/T.' I shouldn't be ashamed of this record, but Glen is such a giant tool in real life, I feel kind of silly listening to it, knowing I can't take him seriously. That said, I love this record.<BR><BR>

		<strong>An album from this year that will end up on your year end list?</strong><BR><BR>

		I was sooooooo apprehensive before the release of <strong>Extol's</strong> self-titled album. Most of the releases they put out after 'Synergy' were hit and miss for me. There were moments on each album that I really enjoyed but there were also tracks that I ALWAYS skipped over.<BR><BR>

		With this album, I felt like they came together as a three-piece and put out an incredible foray into progressive metal. I listen to this record, start to finish, at least once a week since it came out. In my opinion, every track is almost perfect. 'Dawn of Redemption' is the lone exception. The instrumental track goes just a little too long, but I listen all the way through anyway.<BR><BR>

		The tracks 'Extol' and 'Unveiling the Obscure' make this record for me. So many releases lately, for me, have started very strong but peter off in their second half. The last three tracks may be the best.<BR><BR>

		All in all, it's Ole Borud's guitar work that lifts this album above a lot of the releases of this year. The solos are so refreshing. I find myself rewinding to hear them again. Little to no wankery can be found in these jazzy, incendiary exercises. His guitar tone is almost perfect in my ears. Borud's precision on the drums and Espevoll's changing vocal dynamics round it all out. Love it.<BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Elizabeth Ramanand Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Thu, 26 Dec 2013<BR><BR>

		Elizabeth Ramanand (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Lizochka" target="_blank">@Lizochka</a>) was my first (and only) intern during my time running Noise Creep, and she rocked. These days she's holding it down in New York City, photographing and writing about some of the biggest names in the mainstream metal circuit.  <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Well, the album I’m picking isn't old-old since I’m not old-old. I'm only 24 but desperately wished I was born in the '70s. The very first metal album I ever listened to was <strong>Sevendust’s</strong> self-titled debut album. It was early 1999. I was nine years old, very angry about my mother’s passing and I was desperately trying to get this godforsaken CD out of my cousin's CD drive, an old ass, gigantic Hewlett Packard back then.<BR><BR>

		I gave up and let the damn thing play. When it played I didn’t really know what to think and nearly 15 years later, when that guitar riff on 'Black' starts, it gets me. Then the sweetness, mixed with pure hatred of 'Bitch' - come on, what pissed off nine year old wouldn’t love that, right?<BR><BR>

		Since then I’ve been a fan of the Sevendust guys and even got the chance to interview them a couple of times! It's so inspiring when one of your favorite bands is made up of a bunch of sweethearts.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Old album that should embarrassed you but it doesn't?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Kid Rock’s</strong> 'Devil Without a Cause.' I was listening to it the other day and felt the need to apologize for it on Facebook since everyone could see I was rocking out to the 'Rock due to Spotify. I did not apologize for it and spent that Sunday blasting a whole lot of 90s profanity from this very awesome dude.<BR><BR>

		The year 1999 was a big and angry one for me, even as a nine going on to 10 year old. After seeing Kid Rock destroy shit and tear it up on TRL with the ‘Bawitdaba’ video, I had to get the record. It was the first album I bought with my own money. Well, I couldn’t physically buy it since I wasn’t "of age," but with some help it was all mine. I got home and opened that sucker up. On the disc was Kid Rock’s middle finger and born was my love of profanity.<BR><BR>

		Hearing the fusion of rock, hip-hop, soul and a whole bunch of other genres on that album was a different experience especially at a young age. Not to mention the man is a lyrical genius. Take the track 'Bullgod' for example, with the verse "Cause I'm the bullgod you understand / The illegitimate son of man / The T-O-P to the D-O-G / Or the P-O-T to the G-O-D." Alright, it's not the most thought provoking verse but it’s still pretty damn cool.<BR><BR>

		There's also a soft spot in my heart for <strong>Steel Panther</strong>.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What are some albums from the past five years, back to 2009, that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		Oh geez, so much stuff. I love all different genres of music and different sub-genres of metal and rock.  One band that might apply to is <strong>Five Finger Death Punch's</strong> 'War is the Answer.' Their songs are just do damn catchy!<BR><BR>

		Also, one of my all time favorite bands in the world is <strong>Hatebreed</strong>, so when their cover album 'For the Lions' and their self-titled album came out in the same year, I was one happy metal head. At this point I was also 20 years old and less angry, unless I listen to Hatebreed, that is. When 'In Ashes They Shall Reap' is unleashed live, shit hits the fan and there is not a body standing still in the room. That whole album is relentless. Hatebreed were my introduction to hardcore, whether days are good or bad, for years I’ve worn their music like body armor and will continue to do so.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Alice in Chains</strong> 'Black Gives Way to Blue' is one that I play consistently. That grit mixed with tenderness on that album is undeniable. So much of that record is powerful whether it's good ol’ grungy tunes like 'Last of My Kind,' 'Acid Bubble' and 'Private Hell' or warmer melodic gems 'When the Sun Rose Again' and the title track 'Black Gives Way to Blue.' William DuVall and the rest of the gang honor Layne Staley in an incredible way with that record. <BR><BR>

<strong>What&#039;s Matt Hinch Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 31 Dec 2013<BR><BR>

		Matt Hinch lives in Ontario, Canada, where he writes for fine metal publications like <a href="http://www.hellbound.ca/" target="_blank">Hellbound</a>, <a href="http://heavymetal.about.com/" target="_blank">About Heavy Metal</a>, <a href="http://www.scratchthesurface-webzine.com/" target="_blank">Scratched Surface</a>, and <a href="http://metalbandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Metalbandcamp</a>. He's been a jovial part of Skull Toaster for awhile and I'm stoked to discover what he's been listening to all these years. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album gives you chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		I can't say I can think of anything older that gives me the chills. Singing along to 'Woods 5' by <strong>Woods of Ypres</strong> screws my face up into an ugly cry but that's still relatively new. So I'll talk about a different one. <BR><BR>

		My first year of university was a dark time for me. I had plenty of friends I suppose but I always kinda felt like an outsider. I made a mix tape (yes, tape; this was 1997) of songs about suicide (morbid, I know) that I listened to more than I should have. But the one album I kept going back to that whole year was 'Roots' by <strong>Sepultura</strong>. Not the most popular Sepultura album but I loved it. <BR><BR>

		While my roommate was out chasing tail and the room next door was filled with potheads watching TV, I escaped into Roots. It must have been the energy I found there that I preferred over masking my feelings or being someone that I wasn't. And maybe the tribal aspects of it made me feel like I was part of something. I don't know for sure. I've actually never thought about it that way until now. But I played the crap out of that CD all year and it actually earned me my nickname of Metalhead Matt.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		This one's a little easier. <strong>Metallica's</strong> 'Load.' I should be embarrassed about it but I'm not because of the memories attached to it. Summer 1996. Months away from turning 18. Driver's license and virtually unlimited access to my stepdad's truck. Freedom baby. My friend Chad and I were inseparable that summer and we both loved the album. (Different story if it had come out in 2006) We played it constantly all summer. We'd throw on <strong>Rage Against The Machines's</strong> 'Evil Empire' every once in a while for a change of pace. Playing hoops in his driveway, cruising around, camping every weekend. 'Hero of the Day' was our song of the summer. Whenever I think of 'Load' I think of one of my very best friends, and vice versa. And that's nothing to be embarrassed about.<BR><BR>

		<strong>An album from this year that will for sure end up on your year end list</a>?</strong><BR><BR>

		So many to choose from but I have to go with a Canadian group; 'Heart of Oak' by Vancouver's <strong>Anciients</strong> could very well be my favourite album of 2013. I had heard it was good from trusted sources, like the band's manager and Hellbound.ca editor Sean Palmerston. And I had heard their '<a href="http://anciientriffs.bandcamp.com/album/snakebeard-7" target="_blank">Snakebeard</a>' 7" a couple times. But I was still blown away. Impeccable songwriting, brilliant musicianship, incredible dynamics, amazing riffs, riffs and more riffs!<BR><BR>

	<strong>What&#039;s Stephanie Jensen Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 07 Jan 2014<BR><BR>

		Stephanie Jensen (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/stephanie_metal">@stephanie_metal</a>) interviews bands for <a href="http://theageofmetal.com/" target="_blank">The Age Of Metal</a> and <a href="http://thenewfury.com/" target="_blank">New Fury Media</a>, and is a publicist at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KillSHOTPR" target="_blank">Killshot PR</a>. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Holy shit there are several of these. I’m just gonna name them all. Fuck it. Well, my first is 'Iowa' from <strong>Slipknot</strong>. I’m not gonna lie when I say Slipknot was one of the main bands that got me into metal. Hell, Slipknot was the first live show I’ve been to. I will never forget Corey Taylor’s vocals (that still woo me to this day), Joey Jordison’s drumming which was the fastest drumming I ever heard at the time, and of course those damn masks. I still think after that Slipknot show was the first of several bangovers I will ever have.<BR><BR>

		The next one is a slew of <strong>Pantera</strong> albums: 'Cowboys from Hell,' 'Far Beyond Driven,' 'Reinventing the Steel,' and 'Vulgar Display of Power.' I still have no idea what my favorite Pantera album is; they’re all fucking amazing. But like Slipknot, Pantera was one of the first metal bands I listened to. And like Slipknot, Pantera’s music inspired me to resort to metal to release anger and depression I had. You see (warning: sob story coming up) I was bullied when I was young and that whole like, so "fitting in" was always kind of an issue for me. Metal allowed me to say "fuck it" for the first time.<BR><BR>

		My last influential album is 'Human' from <strong>Death</strong>. Before I found out about this wonderful genre called death metal, I was mainly listening to the bands I mentioned previously and also more of the symphonic/power stuff (still a huge fan of <strong>Kamelot</strong> and <strong>Nightwish</strong>, I should add) and didn’t do much to expand from that. But I became friends with this one dude named Leo and he pestered me into listening to death metal. The first album he showed me was 'Human.' The classic Schuldiner riffs, the progressive time signatures (I was only used to <strong>Dream Theater</strong> in terms of progressive metal) mixed in with the rapid style of playing, the heavy groove of Steve DiGiorgio’s bass and the agility of Sean Reinart’s drumming (obviously a huge step above Joey Jordison). In short, I was fucking impressed and amazed. Now look at me, I’m a death metal enthusiast.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		I’m not embarrassed about this at all, but probably 'Spice World' from <strong>Spice Girls</strong>. Girls my age get their panties wet over <strong>N'sync</strong>. Uh, Spice Girls will always and forever be better! Seriously, those girls are still my idols. I agree with Baby Spice in the Spice World movie when she said, “you should be able to order men like a pizza.”<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Between the Buried and Me</strong>, 'The Great Misdirect.' I always hear their fans giving this album shit and I always loved it. And <strong>The Black Dahlia Murder</strong>, 'Deflorate.' Another album fans didn’t care for yet it’s my favorite from them.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it? </strong><BR><BR>

		I was never a big melodic death metal fan; I can't stand <strong>In Flames</strong> and I'm way more of a fan of <strong>Carcass'</strong> earlier material than anything post -'Heartwork.' But it took me forever to get into <strong>At the Gates</strong>. Something in me just decided to listen to them and all I can think of was, "why the hell haven’t I ever listened to this?" I jam 'Slaughter of the Soul' all the time now. But as far as anything else old school, I mean I am twenty-one years old so those bands I discovered within the last five years. But this one is the most recent.<BR><BR>

			<strong>What is Julien Renaud Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 14 Jan 2014<BR><BR>

		Julien Renaud (<a href="https://twitter.com/mrjuj" target="_blank">@mrjuj</a>) is a bearded French-speaking Canadian who grew up in the suburbs of Montréal, and has been following the Skull Toaster since April of 2013. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Name one album that still gives you chills after all these years.</strong><BR><BR>

		Having to choose a single title is hard. I now consider myself a longtime metal listener, with a musical taste spanning multiple sub-genres. Still, the likes of <strong>Bathory</strong>, <strong>Celtic Frost</strong>, <strong>Darkthrone</strong>, <strong>Emperor</strong>, or even <strong>Mercyful Fate</strong> were unknown to me for most of my childhood. Nor was I much aware of what a given subgenre of metal consisted of compared to another, back then. <strong>Dimmu Borgir’s</strong> 'Enthrone Darkness Triumphant' became a milestone to me at the moment it caught my attention. It was one of the albums that made me ask for more, even if this wasn’t my first experience with heavy metal. My quest toward the more extreme side of metal was a progressive one: I first came to appreciate the keyboard-laden melodies before a wider appreciation for black metal grew on me. My musical taste and knowledge may have evolved since then, but I sure still get a kick out of blasting this album at high volume once in a while.<BR><BR>

		<strong>An album that you should be embarrassed about but you're not?</strong><BR><BR>

		I own <strong>Dimmu Borgir’s</strong> 'Abrahadabra' on vinyl. This seems paradoxical considering my previous answer, but it’s among those albums I’ve heard cited again and again as an example of what black metal shouldn’t be, of how the band sell out long ago in order to pursue purely commercial interests. If there was a thing such as an orthodox black metal inquisition, they’d have a reason to knock on my door. But, hey, I can enjoy both this and better recognized, genre-defining classics (albeit for different reasons.) I indulge in albums such as this one just like others eat ice cream straight out of the tub.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Something from the past five years that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		I could answer with more than a handful, but I’ll go with the following: Not long before accepting to answer these questions, I listened to <strong>Dark Castle’s</strong> 'Spirited Migration' (released in 2009.) Sit back, let that record play from the beginning to the end, and be crushed under this duo’s heaviness. <BR><BR>

	<strong>What&#039;s Jonna Robertson Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 20 Jan 2014<BR><BR>

		Jonna Robertson (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonnachicago" target="_blank">@jonnachicago</a>) works at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FayzMusicManagement" target="_blank">Fayz Media</a> doing management, tour marketing / press, and social media. Check out and listen to a few albums that Jonna has been listening to over the years. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Rush</strong>, '2112.' My best friend and first boyfriend was a crazy Rush fan so he made me listen to them constantly and this album in particular. At first I didn't really get it but the narrative and theatrical nature of it totally grew on me and I became a fan, too. Tragically, he passed away that same year. I'm still a diehard Rush fan and I can't hear a song from 2112 without thinking of him. I have a 2112 tattoo that I got as a tribute two years ago on 12/21/12. Nerd alert!<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		That's a tough one. I'm sure many of my choices would be considered "embarrassing," since I grew up in the 80s. I still spin my <strong>Skid Row</strong>, <strong>Cinderella</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong> pretty regularly. OK, I'll take this opportunity to give a shout out to Tesla. Everyone thinks of 'Love Song' but they've written some  good songs over the years and they are great live. Yes, I've seen them a few times. I'm sure people would laugh at me for all the country music I like too. I'm a huge George Strait fan. That's what happens when you grow up in Oklahoma.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it? </strong><BR><BR>

		'Don't Break the Oath,' <strong>Mercyful Fate</strong>. I was seven when that album came out and my first introduction to metal didn't come until a few years later. My cousin would play <strong>Motley Crüe</strong> and <strong>Alice Cooper</strong> records because she liked anything that might shock the people. As I said earlier, I was initially more of a Skid Row kind of girl, but eventually my tastes got heavier. (Thank you, <strong>Pantera</strong> and <strong>Metallica</strong>)<BR><BR>

		I think the first time I even heard of King Diamond was on Headbanger's Ball. As a 13 or 14 year old girl, I was quite frankly kind of scared! <BR><BR>

		Now I'm always digging into the metal archives looking for gems I've missed so when I came across this one a few years ago I was hooked.  I'm the type that listens to albums in full so this one is exceptional because every single song is great. Eerie and evil...it's so metal.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Travis Turner Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 27 Jan 2014<BR><BR>

		I met Travis Turner (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/trav610" target="_blank">@trav610</a>) when he was playing drums in <strong>Crutch</strong> / <strong>Aletheian</strong>, back in 2000 or so. He's been keeping busy (listen to his <a href="http://mynameistrav.com/recordings" target="_blank">discog here</a>), and we've been coffee drinking buds ever since. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Strongarm</strong>, 'Advent Of As Miracle' (1997). The ending of the last song 'The Fall Of Babylon' literally still sends chills down my back. As Chris screams "but for those of you who refuse to see, leading others astray with your iniquities: TERROR WILL SIEZE YOU!!! The hour of your judgement....will....come," I lose my mind. I form a pit where ever I am and start windmilling. No I'm kidding.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What made that happen? Just the time period, something in life you got through, some huge memory attached?</strong><BR><BR>

		Well, 1996-97 was a journey back to Christ for me. I walked away from my fiancé. Acted like an ass for about a year and a half, drank too much, burned too many bridges. Then hit my knees, asked forgiveness and was able to rebuild what I tried to burn, and got back with my fiancé. Been married 13 years now. I was leading others away from my beliefs with my actions and, well... terror seized me!<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not?</strong><BR><BR>

		I will stand here and tell you that I 100% will defend everything <strong>Stryper</strong> has ever made. Love love love em.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Why aren't you embarrassed by it?</strong><BR><BR>

		Uh, because they're still awesome to me. I have never gotten tired to listening to any of their stuff. Even their new "not as good" stuff is good. I take a lot of heat for my Stryper love, but they were it. My little 12 year old world revolved around those guys, man. That's why I'm not ashamed. I am playing the drums today because of Robert Sweet...among others.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's some classic album you didn't listen to years ago, and you finally did, and now you love it?</strong><BR><BR>

		Hmm, <strong>The Clash</strong>. Shame on me. I like "smart" punk bands and I missed one of the smartest. The first time I ever payed attention to 'London Calling' was to learn it as a cover with my old band <strong>The Houselights</strong>. So around 2003-ish? Then nothing. Then about a year ago I learned that <strong>The Police</strong>  - my favorite band - took their name from a Clash song. So I went digging and now I really like what I've found.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Chris Crawford Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 03 Feb 2014<BR><BR>

		The Mod Cabin</a> brand from Skull Toaster follower <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jarrod_newcom" target="_blank">@jarrod_newcom</a>. I got in touch with Chris Crawford, maker of fine facial hair goodies, and we talked about music from over the years. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		I'm going to half to go with <strong>Black Flag's</strong> 1985 album 'Loose Nut.' It's probably the first time I heard any metal/punk hybrid music.<BR><BR>

		Some of the songs - 'Bastard in Love,' 'Annihilate this Week,' and 'Modern Man' give me chills when I listen to them. I think I have listened to at least one song from that album since I first bought the tape in the mid 80s. <BR><BR>

		I was a teenager from a broken home bouncing around the country when I first heard it. It had a big effect on my young mind. I found a lot of comfort in it for whatever reason.  Listening to that album is sort of like getting nostalgic over really bad times. As I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate the bad times in my life as much as the good. It was during the hard times that I developed the strength to create good times for myself down the road. So in a way listening to that album is my own little tribute to overcoming weakness. 
<BR><BR>
		If I remember correctly the band wasn’t that fond of the album, but I stand by my assertion that 'Loose Nut' is the best album <strong>Black Flag</strong> ever made.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		I don't know if its ridiculed or just not considered one of their better albums, but I really enjoy <strong>Megadeth's</strong> 'Cryptic Writings.'<BR><BR>

		There is a bit of a story behind this. Dave Mustaine was actually trying to help me overcome my alcohol addiction at the time the album was released, in 1997. The song 'Use the Man' is about another guy Mustaine was trying to help out. Unfortunately that guy died of an overdose. <BR><BR>

		When the album came out I knew who the song was about and remembered him OD’ing. It was kind of a surreal time for me; here I was this drunken homeless dude hanging out with rich rock stars like Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson. They were good guys but I must say their lifestyle didn't live up to the image I had of them. I’ll never forget hanging out in Dave Ellefson’s house and hearing his wife say she wanted just one more Norman Rockwell style Christmas before she had to tell her kids Santa wasn’t real. <BR><BR>

		So, long story short, whenever I hear that album I get very sentimental over that time, even though that time sucked me for. But there are some songs I really love on that album – 'Use The Man,' 'Mastermind' and 'Trust' are probably not considered some of <strong>Megadeth's</strong> best songs, but I really enjoy them.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		I still listen to <strong>Soilent Green's</strong> 'Inevitable Collapse in the Presence of Conviction.'<BR><BR>

		I had listened to their earlier stuff but kind of forgot about them, then I was watching Squidbillies one night and out of nowhere Soilent Green is playing the opening theme song sludge-metal style. I checked out their latest stuff and found 'Inevitable Collapse in the Presence of Conviction.; They remind me of some of the grindcore bands I like, but less preachy. And I like how they mix some acoustic stuff in now and then just to throw you off.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal (or grind.. hah) album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong> <BR><BR>

		I finally got around to listening to <strong>Napalm Death’s</strong> first album 'SCUM' and I love it. It's just a straight up classic. When you name your band Napalm Death you have a lot to live up to, and I think they lived up to the name and more. Its just good, hard, shove it down your throat music. Hard not to like and appreciate that.

		<strong>What&#039;s Jeremy Hunt Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 18 Feb 2014<BR><BR>

		Jeremy Hunt (<a href="https://twitter.com/jehuthehunt" target="_blank">@jehuthehunt</a>) was Skull Toaster's 23rd follower, from when we started this thing back in October, 2011, so I'm stoked to have picked his brain for all the tunes he's been listening to over the years. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		I should probably preface all of my answers by saying that I'm a bit of a latecomer when it comes to metal. As a kid, I grew up listening to film scores and rock from the 60s and 70s and it wasn't until high school and college that I really got into heavier music. It started with punk and hardcore and eventually metal started bleeding into the picture. The band that actually helped bridge that gap from hardcore to metal for me was <strong>Thrice</strong> and their second album, 'The Illusion of Safety.' <BR><BR>

		As clichéd as it might sound now, I stumbled across their music video for 'Deadbolt' and was instantly hooked. It was the first time I'd heard metal riffs mixed with hardcore and blew my mind. I went out, bought the CD and fell in love with the rest of the record as well. It might be hard to remember 12 years after the fact (has it really be 12 years since this came out??), but at that point, 'metalcore' hadn't been completely played out and hearing music like this at that time was pretty electrifying.<BR><BR>

		From a personal standpoint, my time in college was filled with experiences like this. While I had a great musical foundation as a kid, my college years felt like one long journey of awesome discovery after awesome discovery. This was also the time period where I started freelance writing and covering music for an online (and soon-to-be print) magazine. It gave me the opportunity to not only listen to and review music, but to start participating in that world, interviewing some of my favorite artists and bands, and making friends with some incredible people along the way. And ultimately, my freelancing led me to meeting my amazing wife. Kinda hard to top that.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Name an old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		I'm a firm believer that no one should have "guilty pleasures." We like what we like and listen to what we listen to and there shouldn't be any reason to feel guilty about any of that...unless of course you like <strong>Kesha</strong> or <strong>BrokeNcyde</strong>. In that case, you might just need to get your head examined. <BR><BR>

		That said, while it's not a metal album/band, I'd have to go with 'Be Here Now' by <strong>Oasis</strong>. <BR><BR>

		While '(What's The Story) Morning Glory?' was universally praised and loved, 'Be Here Now' seemed to get the exact same measure of criticism and hatred in the years since. And even with all the time in the world for distance and clarity, I still dig this record. Yes, most of the songs go on way too long and they're over the top, but it's still a fun listen when I'm in the right mood for it.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (going back to 2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong><BR><BR>

		I could probably write a whole book on this one question alone, but since I have to pick just one album, I'll go with 'Wavering Radiant' by <strong>ISIS</strong>. <BR><BR>

		Over the years, I've often found that the bands and records that end up sticking with me the most are the ones that initially confuse me, the ones that don't make sense on my first listen, the ones that push my ears and my brain in a new direction. That was certainly true of ISIS when I started listening to them. I jumped in around the midpoint of their career with 'Panopticon.' I had read a few reviews that made me think they were worth listening to and I picked it up...and nothing. It wasn't what I was expecting and it just didn't click with me. But I held on to it and checked it out a few more times and it started making sense.<BR><BR>

		Fast forward to 'Wavering Radiant' and everything about ISIS finally started falling into place for me. I completely fell in love with them. As a result, I gained a new appreciation for their older work. And while I really enjoy those albums, 'Wavering Radiant' is a masterpiece from a band that seemed to be reaching new heights even as they called it quits. Every single track is powerful and perfectly written. It also helps that the record is bookended by two of the best pieces ISIS ever wrote, 'Hall of the Dead' and 'Threshold of Transformation.' The former is a potent way to kick things off while the latter is one hell of a closer, a transcendent ten minute journey that somehow manages to sum up the entire record in a truly epic manner. While I hate that this ended up being their final studio album, you have to respect them for going out at the top of their game. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Renn Hadley Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 10 Feb 2014<BR><BR>

			The ever awesome Renn Hadley (<a href="https://twitter.com/MamafogK" target="_blank">@MamafogK</a>), mother of a child with autism and science fiction romance writer, took the time to talk about the albums and the music she loves. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Sepultura</strong>, 'Chaos A.D.'  For the longest time, I had only heard Sepultura on poor quality dubbed tapes. I listened to them over and over again. I wrote to people, asked anyone - "Where can I find some Sepultura?" I finally found 'Chaos, A.D.' in a local record store.  It was even better than I hoped. So interesting, so heavy, with that wide open seize the world sound. At the time, I thought,  if music could sound so good AND I could buy it in a store, the world had to be an amazing place.<BR><BR>

		I'll admit I'm not as impressed with the sound quality of 'Chaos A.D.' as I was back then. But songs like 'Biotech is Godzilla,' sound fresh, and might be even more appropriate these days. Every time I hear the opening of 'Refuse/Resist' it still makes me feel like the world is full of wonderful things to be discovered. <BR><BR>

		Back in the day, I remember telling my friends that 'Chaos A.D.' would  stay with me forever. I'd play it in the old age home. I never imagined there would be decades of metal to follow and how the internet would blur the fringe and make everything more accessible.  Listening to the album makes me happy I don't have to work hard to find good music anymore. And I'm not limited to the music of my past.   While I'm sure Sepultura will be on my retirement home playlist someday, they will be featured among decades of metal.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		I'm past being embarrassed by any of my music choices. But I am a little embarrassed I hold on to a box of cassettes when I doubt I'll ever use a tape player again.  In that collection I have an old tape by <strong>Hostile Omish</strong>.  The same songs are on the CD 'Olde Order of Omish'.  The band is still together and they have continued to release music. It isn't my usual listening style, but songs like 'Omish Ex-Communicated Blues; are amusing. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Slayer</strong>, 'World Painted Blood.'  This isn't my favorite Slayer album. It took a few listens to get used to how clear the music sounds. I kind of miss mentally diving into their muddy mix to find those swingy, groovy riffs that aren't really there.  I've come to appreciate that this is a different sound for Slayer. The drums are loud and right up front, and the blistering speed feels precise not chaotic, like they can launch us into orbit. This is the album to play when I want to get something done. <BR><BR>

		The title song is my favorite these days. 

<BR><BR>

			<strong>What&#039;s Kelly Walsh Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 24 Feb 2014<BR><BR>

		Kelly Walsh (<a href="https://twitter.com/kellyohno" target="_blank">@kellyohno</a>) is a publicist at Prosthetic Records and, according to her bio, she loves "metal, oddities & taxidermy," which means she fits right in here on Skull Toaster! Please enjoy. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> <BR><BR>

		<strong>H.I.M.</strong>, 'Deep Shadows & Brilliant Highlights.' H.I.M. is my all-time favorite band just thinking about listening to this album and I'm already singling along in my head. <BR><BR>


		Each song is so perfectly constructed and Ville's voice was at it's prime, especially on 'Close To The Flame' and 'Please Don't Let It Go.'  I was fighting depression when this album came out and it was one of the albums that helped me push through. I still can't listen to it in full without crying!<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not?</strong><BR><BR>

		Well personally, I don't feel that anyone should be embarrassed by anything that they enjoy. Music is a personal preference and everyone should be able to listen to anything that makes them happy and not worry about judgement. <BR><BR>

		I guess the album that people would THINK I'd be embarrassed to say that I like is <strong>Marina and The Diamonds</strong>, 'The Family Jewels.' It's pure bubblegum pop and I absolutely love it!<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Sun O)))</strong>, 'Monoliths & Dimensions.' It's simply breathtaking - I could listen to this album day after day and never tire of it. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Dream Theater</strong>, 'Scenes From A Memory.' I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of prog so while I was familiar with the band I never really paid much attention to their music. I really love concept albums so a friend suggested, or should I say FORCED, me to give it a listen and I was immediately drawn in! <BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Jordan Munson Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 04 Mar 2014<BR><BR>

		I met Jordan Munson (<a href="https://twitter.com/jordanmunson" target="_blank">@jordanmunson</a>) a few years back, through our previous employers at the time. Years later I crashed at his place in lovely Massachusetts and I tell you, the guy is a gem. High fives! <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Hmm, I think a couple come to mind. Firstly, the album that really got me into metal:<BR> <strong>Metallica's</strong> 'Master of Puppets.' That album still hits the spot every time I put it on. I also revisit <strong>Black Sabbath's</strong> 'Paranoid' and <strong>Iron Maiden's</strong> 'Number of the Beast' quite frequently. Every time I hear the opening line from 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' it puts me in a special place.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Old album that you should be embarrassed by but you're not.</strong><BR><BR>

		I dunno, this is generally a thing that I shy away from. There was a time in my life where I hid a number of "guilty pleasures" but that's really foolish. I unabashedly enjoy <strong>Limp Bizkit's</strong> 'Three Dollar Bill, Y'all' and most of <strong>Nonpoint's</strong> discography. If I like the music, I like the music--naysayers be damned. Who's someone else to say I shouldn't enjoy music?<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Converge's</strong> 'Axe To Fall' and <strong>Junius'</strong> 'Reports From The Threshold of Death' both still see pretty regular rotation for me. I just recently started listening to these guys, but <strong>Reign Supreme's</strong> 'Testing The Limits of Infinite' has really been hitting the spot for me on a consistent basis. Same goes for <strong>ASG's</strong> 'Win Us Over' falls into that same bucket. I'm still jamming on <strong>Protest The Hero's</strong> 'Scurrilous' a ton, especially since their latest album dropped. That one is a surefire classic, I'd almost put money on it.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong><BR><BR>

		This question is really tough. As someone who got really deep into metal for a number of years, I pretty much discovered all the classics a while back. That said, it took me a long while to truly enjoy <strong>Emperor's</strong> material, though I always held a pretty strong appreciation for their work (especially Ihsahn's genius). <BR><BR>

		It wasn't until I spent a lot of time with Ihsahn's solo catalog that I was finally able to truly enjoy Emperor's back catalog. Fun fact: Ihsahn is responsible for one of the only metal songs that's actually made me weep. It was the first time I heard 'On Her Shores' and it was so beautiful at that moment that I found myself totally overwhelmed. True story.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Lindsey Turnbullet Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 11 Mar 2014<BR><BR>

		I'm stoked to feature Lindsey Turnbullet (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Scrapyardzine" target="_blank">@Scrapyardzine</a>) this week, my metal pal that runs <a href="http://scrapyardmagazine.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Scrapyard Magazine</a>. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		There are so many albums that I listen to that still give me chills.  <strong>Exodus</strong>, 'Bonded by Blood,' from the airplane intro to the very end just gets me pumped.  Both <strong>Acid Bath</strong> albums I know by heart and can get me out of any bad mood.  Anything- ANYTHING- Dax Riggs has ever done is phenomenal.  Some of his covers have legit moved me to tears.  I still think 'Storm of the Light's Bane' (<strong>Dissection</strong>) is one of the most flawless pieces of music ever to be made. <BR><BR>


		I am an emotional person, specific emotions get attached to certain bands/albums/songs and when I play them, I still feel that emotion as strongly. It's a blessing and a curse, haha.  At least albums I loved once and have generally happy memories attached to, I will love forever.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		My un-ironic enjoyment of hair/glam metal is always ridiculed. I like to have fun and dance like an idiot and sing loudly and badly. I fail to see the problem with that, but everyone else does.  Until I bust out some dance moves, anyway. Then they're just laughing at me, not the music.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		Oh man!  There's been some good shit!  I adore Dax Riggs' post-Acid Bath work. Both his solo albums rule, but they're nothing like Acid Bath. <strong>Speedwolf</strong> is a great up and coming band and 'Ride with Death' is a great, fun album.  <BR><BR>

		The new <strong>Nasuea</strong> and latest <strong>Exhumed</strong> records see a lot of play.  I listen to <strong>Goatsnake</strong> pretty much every time I drive to Baltimore, MD. 'Flower of Disease' is exactly as long as the drive from my house to the door of the Sidebar.  <strong>Man's Gin</strong> is another great project that I listen to... well, a lot.  Oh man, I can't leave out all the Ihsahn either. Or my friends in <strong>Genocide Shrines</strong>; they're from Sri Lanka and there is some amazingly sick and evil music coming from that part of the world.  I am sure I am forgetting tons of stuff. <BR><BR>

		I know it's cool to shit on new bands and new material, there's just so much good stuff out there.  It's hard for me to really get hooked into a new band because I'm already in love with so much older music, but that doesn't mean there's not good shit out there.  Or that no one is innovating anymore.  Personally, when I'm in a good mood (like lately) I want music I know all the words to, so I put on like, old <strong>Morbid Angel</strong> or <strong>Judas Priest</strong> hits or that evil hair metal and sing loud as hell.  When I'm in a bad mood, I want something comforting, something I know like a well-worn blanket- more old music.  I've been better this year though, about listening to new stuff.  I think I've listened to like, 10 new albums already!  That's practically a record.<BR><BR>

		I also jammed the new <strong>Carcass</strong> a lot.  I stuck it in my car, it’s the only CD in there, so it plays when I may short drives.  I moved across the country and I was dealing with the end of a long term relationship, and there’s like, these little nuggets of wisdom in there.  "The best vengeance is living well?"  It's  like the whole album was written for me, in that moment.  Then I got dumped by someone else and that album was still in my car. "Love is a bitch, it maims to please?" Seriously, that is a great break up album, haha, and I played that track ('316 L Grade Surgical Steel') more times than I will admit publicly.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it?</strong> <BR><BR>

		Not classic, but once I held out on listening to Man's Gin because my roommate was so obnoxious about it.  I missed out, haha.  I'm friends with Erik now, he even thanked me on their second album, so I think it's funny. I listen to that band ALL THE TIME. I was being a stubborn asshole!<BR><BR>

		Normally though, I have the opposite experience.  Everyone talks up a band and I listen to it and I'm like "seriously, all the hype is for this?!  You all need to chill out and go listen to some <strong>Venom</strong> or <strong>Bathory</strong> or something before you start hyping these mediocre, recycled riff-fests.  Yes, I am sure it's fun live.  No, I really don't need to give it another chance."  This probably contributes to me not listening to tons of new material.  I'd probably be less disappointed if there was less hype.<BR><BR>

		I know most of the classics, of course, but I think I missed out on a bunch of stuff that was just shy of "making it." There's probably a ton of classic albums I've missed and would love.  You can tweet your suggestions to me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/scrapyardzine" target="_blank">@scrapyardzine</a>! <BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Ben Pike Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Sun, 16 Mar 2014<BR><BR>

		I've known Ben Pike for many years now, through my various music blogs, so I'm very happy to have him so involved with things here at Skull Toaster! Onto the music! <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Sepultura</strong> - 'Chaos A.D. - This album was not my introduction to Sepultura.  Around 2001-2002 I had discovered 'Nation' and enjoyed it so much I wanted to get my hands on EVERYTHING they had ever released, so when I saw this CD at the local record shop I bought it immediately. I was still easing my way into heavy metal and this was my first foray into the "thrash" subgenre. I had no idea what I was in for. I had never heard anything so raw, so loud, so fast, and so unrelenting. <BR><BR>

		Don't get me wrong 'Roots' is fantastic in its own right, but 'Chaos A.D.' is a force to be reckoned with! I drove my parents and siblings crazy trying to learn every guitar riff on this album at full volume. Every time I listen to this album it gets my blood pumping and I can't help but whip out my air guitar and reminisce about learning every song backwards and forwards.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Staind</strong>, '14 Shades Of Grey.' I've always thought this record was well produced, well recorded, and well written. This album also hit me at just the right time. It came out when I was 18 and had just graduated high school so I was definitely still in my impressionable years musically. The emotions I can relate to almost every song on this album runs the gamut - many (now) bittersweet and nostalgic memories there.<BR><BR>

		<strong>(hed) P.E.</strong>, 'Broke.' I love my parents - we got along surprisingly well when I was a teenager growing up. Hell, my dad took me to countless shows and festivals over the years before I could drive. If there's one thing they shared with me it was their love of music, but they were rather controlling of the music I listened to growing up when it came to music with explicit lyrics.<BR><BR>

		When I turned 16 it was a special kind of freedom to not only go out on my own, but I could also buy music unsupervised. I was REALLY into rap-metal at the time so this was one of the first albums I bought with my own money and my new found freedom from censorship. It was so vile and disgusting and cheesy and catchy and loud. Many fond memories driving around town with friends trying to offend pedestrians.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Soul Embraced</strong>, 'Mythos.' I think it's a travesty that this album didn't make it onto more 2013 "Best Of" lists. This album embodies everything that's right with modern heavy metal music. It's bone-crushingly heavy, dark, and never misses a groove. <BR><BR>

		They even go so far as to say to djent bands "no THIS is how you do it" during the break-down on the track "They Live, We Sleep". I had been looking forward to this album for five years and it didn't disappoint!<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Kim Kelly Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 24 Mar 2014<BR><BR>

		Kim Kelly (<a href="https://twitter.com/GrimKim" target="_blank">@grimkim</a>) and I worked together during my time as editor of Noise Creep, way back in 2009 (hard to believe that was five years ago), so I'm excited to share what Kim has been listening to all these years later. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> <BR><BR>

		<strong>Samothrace's</strong> 'Life's Trade' is one of the most perfect albums ever recorded. I'm impressed anew every time the shimmering delicacy of 'La Llorona's' opening moments comes crashing down, down, down into roaring, cacophonous waves of doom. It's beautiful, and desperate, and very honest. That band is on a whole 'nother level. When I was about 19 I snuck into a bar to see them play on this tour, and despite my terror at being detected, it was so, so worth it. <BR><BR>

		I feel the same way about <strong>Thou's</strong> 'Peasant,'  <strong>Horna's</strong> 'Envaatnags Eflos Solf Esgantaavne,' <strong>Eyehategod's</strong> 'Dopesick,' <strong>Nirvana's</strong> '<a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Nirvana/album/From_The_Muddy_Banks_Of_The_Wishkah/" target="_blank">From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah</a>,' and <strong>Necros Christos</strong>' 'Black Mass Desecration' demo. Untouchable. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you love that is typically ridiculed?</strong> <BR><BR>

		I'm not embarrassed about anything I listen to, from <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> to <strong>Stalaggh</strong>. I've still got mad love for awkward folk punk like <strong>Johnny Hobo & the Freight Trains</strong> because it reminds me of high school summers spent sneaking out to punk shows with my best friend, and my adoration for even the poppier side of country music is well-documented. Admittedly , I do like to torment my other half with <strong>Toby Keith</strong> from time to time!<BR><BR>

		I suppose I get the most guff about my perceived insistence on listening to ridiculously low-fi black metal at all times. I mean, I love <strong>Ildjarn</strong> and <strong>Torgeist</strong> as much as the next gal, but come on, that's not all I'm into! My prized possession is my grandma's original copy of <strong>Loretta Lynn's</strong> 'Coal Miner's Daughter' for chrissakes. It lives next to my <strong>Conqueror</strong> records, but still.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		<strong>Nux Vomica's</strong> 2009 album 'Asleep in the Ashes' is jaw-dropping in its artistry; no other band could combine melodic death, doom, crust, black metal, sludge and ambient elements and create something so monumental and complete. <BR><BR>

		I can't get enough of <strong>Cloud Rat's</strong> 'Moksha,' or Vemod's incredible 'Venter På Stormene,' either. <strong>Darkestrah</strong> stealthily released a new album last year that's been blowing up my speakers with synthy black goodness lately, and <strong>Shackles for a Crown's</strong> 2013 demo is impressive as well. So much music, so little time...<BR><BR>

		You know what, fuck it all. Just listen to <strong>Venom</strong>.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Chris Redar Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 31 Mar 2014<BR><BR>

		Chris Redar answers @skulltoaster metal trivia on a daily basis, then I praise him for his heavy metal wisdom. We have a special relationship like that. After you read this interview, increase your metal knowledge by reading his column, <a href="http://lastrit.es/articles/764/rev-and-redar" target="_blank">Rev and Redar</a>, over at the wonderful Last Rites. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong><BR><BR>

		I'm going to have to go with my personal game-changer here: <strong>Pig Destroyer</strong>, 'Prowler in the Yard.' I was listening to 'extreme' music (which, as time has worn on, has become a word I've come to loathe) before 'Prowler in the Yard,' but that was the one that really clicked. We're talking like, second one of the intro, and the teeth were already in. <BR><BR>

		Every aspect of this; the lyrics, the running order, the presentation... I can still look back on it as 'the bar', so to speak. Despite the awful direction Pig Destroyer has been heading lately ('Book Burner' apologists; fight me), they'll always have at least one part of my psyche forever on lock. <BR><BR>

		It's an album I'll probably never listen to again, either. I was so completely obsessed with 'Prowler in the Yard' that it's basically all I listened to for like two years straight. Suffice to say, it's memorized. More than memorized - I'll be forgetting people were alive before I forget the lyrics to '<a href="http://rd.io/x/QEZ0K36B-w/" target="_blank">Ghost of a Bullet</a>.' Fun fact: that track was -- wait for it -- my pager tone. So, I'm old. Sue me.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		Oh, lord, where do I start? We're talking about albums that meatheads don't like, right? I guess my friends that I don't talk to that much used to give me a good deal of shit about my possession/affinity for 'Ultra' by <strong>Depeche Mode</strong>. <BR><BR>

		It's weird- it's never 'Violator.' I assume because 'Violator' is basically half of a "greatest hits" album, so there's less shame in 'knowing' the music. But 'Ultra?' Throw that on for a group of drunk assholes at 1am and see if you don't get booed out of the car. And it's your car. Fuck 'em though, "guilty" pleasures are silly. I like 'Ultra' a whole hell of a lot. Cats can walk their ass home next time.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		It finds its way in and out of my rotation due to the moody nature of myself, but 2011's 'Pain is a Warning' by <strong>Today is the Day</strong>. When it's in there, though, odds are I'm either crying myself to sleep (harder than usual, anyway) or considering quitting my job and moving into the woods to raise my kids as wolves. <BR><BR>

		It's the most up-and-down album of an already up-and-down career (and yes, that includes Sadness Will Prevail). They were in the studio thinking, "should we make a rock album, a metal album, or an old-timey country album?" and I'm guessing Steve Austin was like, "fuck it- let's just do all three!" And it is just great, like most things TITD have done. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong><BR><BR> 

		I've grown rather fond of 'Blues For the Red Sun' by <strong>Kyuss</strong> since the Vista Chino album came out (and went out with zero notice) last year. <BR><BR>

		Not sure how that one slipped through the cracks, outside of me being ten when it was released. Now I have another reason to despise Josh Homme, so thanks, Kyuss!!<BR><BR>

		<strong>What&#039;s Jordan Campbell Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 07 Apr 2014<BR><BR>

		Jordan Campbell (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/wolfpockets" target="_blank">@wolfpockets</a>) is the editor of <a href="http://lastrit.es" target="_blank">Last Rites</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/YourLastRites" target="_blank">@YourLastRites</a>), and contributing writer to Backlit and AMG. His words are wise. <BR><BR>


		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		There are are a handful albums that I associate with landmarks of my youth, records that were true relevations: <strong>Deep Purple's</strong> 'Made In Japan,' <strong>Metallica's</strong> '...And Justice For All,' <strong>Sepultura's</strong> 'Chaos AD,' <strong>In Flames'</strong> 'Colony.' Certain moments on these records (like Jon Lord's organ riff in 'Highway Star' or that white-hot intro lick from 'Embody the Invisible') throw me back to the moment when I was nine or 16 or whatever and hearing 'em for the first time.<BR><BR>

		But an entire album that still peaks the goosebumps on the regular? <strong>Devin Townsend's</strong> 'Ocean Machine: Biomech.' It works as such a brilliant counterpoint to 'City;' where <strong>Strapping Young Lad</strong> was the outlet for uncontrollable fury, 'Ocean Machine' was introspective and haunting. It's a wistful, oft-frustrated meditation on youth, but to this day, it doesn't sound contrived or naive. And that scream at the end of 'Things Beyond Things' gets me every time.
<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed? Something friends might roll their eyes at?</strong><BR><BR>

		Um...proabably too many to mention here. I listen to a lot of terrible music, from early-ish <strong>INXS</strong> to <strong>Reinkaos</strong>.<BR><BR>

		Anyway, <strong>Tears For Fears'</strong> 'Songs From the Big Chair' is probably my favorite record of all time, and if someone can't appreciate pop perfection -- or the too-smart, minimalist solo in "Shout" -- I'll be the one rolling my eyes. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong> Anything from a "year end" list that you still can't put down?</strong><BR><BR>

		Well, fuck, I hope that sticking with stuff that makes personal lists is the norm, not notable. But in this culture of disposability (rife with music scribblers knocking out lists of the Top 50 Promos That Landed in My Inbox in 20**), I guess that's a valid question.<BR><BR>

		Selected old-ish albums that get still get tons of spins: <strong>Cloudkicker's</strong> 'Beacons,' <strong>Valborg's</strong> 'Crown of Sorrow,' and <strong>Blut Aus Nord's</strong> 'Memoria Vetusta II: Dialogue with the Stars.' But <strong>Woods of Ypres'</strong> 'Woods 4: The Green Album' has been truly glued to my soul since its release. There's just so much life packed into that record. It's overlong and manic, sure, but it's so human. That kind of soul is sorely missing from modern metal. <BR><BR>


		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it? </strong><BR><BR>

		Over the past couple years, I've developed a severe aversion the overproduced, over-technical stuff that's flooding the market, so I've been playing around in pools of raw black metal and punk. (Ironically enough, I stumbled into a recent love affair with <strong>Accept's</strong> 'Restless and Wild' through a weird source: Ammit's way-sloppy cover of '<a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Ammit/album/Hammer_of_Darkness/track/Fast_as_a_Shark/" target="_blank">Fast as a Shark</a>.') However, my urges for primal thrash remained somewhat unsatiated. Then it dawned on me: Why the hell haven't I been blasting early <strong>Voivod</strong> and <strong>Kreator</strong>?<BR><BR>

		Both bands have had long careers packed with "mature" material that, while teeming with merit, leaves me cold. Many will argue that they have better albums, but Voivod's 'Rrröööaaarrr' and Kreator's 'Endless Pain' are my most recent old-school obsessions / revelations. <BR><BR>

		What are Ryan and Natalie of Violent Resonance Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 14 Apr 2014<BR><BR>

		Editor Ryan Stephenson and Designer/Editor Natalie Tracy of <a href="http://www.violentresonance.com/" target="_blank">Violent Resonance</a> chime in this week for a double dose of metal music nerdery. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album that still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Ryan: <strong>Neurosis</strong>' 'Through Silver in Blood.' I was somewhat late to the band, only finding them around the time I was 19. But as soon as I heard that album I was hooked. That album has a lot of memories of rough times attached to it. It also helped changed the way I listen to music. A lot of my music collection grew tiresome after I found that album, and in turn, I started listening to a lot of music from the 80s & 90s that I had missed out on, or hadn't given a chance. <BR><BR>


		Natalie: For me, it's got to be <strong>Judas Priest's</strong> 'Hell Bent For Leather.' I didn't really get my foot through the door on metal until later in high school -- I was more into punk. Since no one in my family really listened to that kind of stuff, I just kind of felt my way through the classics first and expanded outward from there. The first time I heard 'Hell Bent for Leather' (the track), the guitar solo made the hair on the back of my neck stand up -- still does. After that I just kept wanting to find more music that could produce that kind of reaction in me. You could say this album is at least partially responsible for creating a monster.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		Ryan: I listen to (<strong>Metallica's</strong>) 'Death Magnetic' more than I really care to admit. Overall, a fair amount of the songs are good, that production though... Let's hope the new album (whenever it comes out) is produced by someone that isn't Rick Rubin or Bob Rock.<BR><BR>

		Natalie: Gross, Ryan! (Just kidding!) I'm gonna have to go with <strong>Danzig's</strong> first album, 'Danzig.' I know, I'm a terrible person. Not sure if the album itself is typically ridiculed or just Glenn Danzig. He has turned into serious meme-fodder over the years and hasn't put out anything worth listening to in ages (in my opinion), but I still love his music from the 80s.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		Ryan: I still listen to <strong>Isis</strong>' 'Wavering Radiant' (2009) quite a bit. I'm a fan of all their output, and still listen to all their stuff on a regular basis as well. 'Sorrow and Extinction' (2012) from <strong>Pallbearer</strong> is another one. I can honestly say that a week hasn't gone by since I first heard it, that I don't listen to that record at least three or four times.<BR><BR>

		Natalie: There are a lot of albums from within the last five years that I still listen to regularly. The one I have been listening to the most, by far, has got to be <strong>Acid Witch</strong>, 'Stoned' (2010). <strong>Necros Christos</strong>, 'Doom of the Occult' (2011) is another one I listen to at least once or twice a week. When I find an album I like, I tend to listen to it until I can't stand to hear it anymore for awhile. I'm definitely one of those jerks that annoys the crap out of the people close to them by listening to the same things over and over again, haha.

			<strong>What&#039;s Jonathan Dick Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 21 Apr 2014<BR><BR>

			The writing of Jonathan Dick (<a href="https://twitter.com/steelforbrains" target="_blank">@steelforbrains</a>) has appeared on Brooklyn Vegan, Invisible Oranges, Noisey, Stereogum and his own mighty steed, <a href="http://www.steelforbrains.com/" target="_blank">Steel for Brains</a>. It's my pleasure, now, to feature his words of wit and charm here on Skull Toaster.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Man, that’s tough.  Honestly, there are more than a few albums that would easily qualify for this, but one I think I’m constantly revisiting is 'Dirt.'  <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> epitomized that whole grunge scene for me, and that album in particular has a tone and atmosphere to it that sets it apart from the near infinite amount of albums and artists who were riding that train in 1992.  I hear more of AIC’s influence in heavy bands today than I do <strong>Nirvana</strong>, and I think it’s indicative of the specific kind of aesthetic those guys were tapping into at the time.  <BR><BR>

		It’s a genuinely chilling record mainly because you’ve got Staley and Cantrell using this gorgeous vocal harmony paired up against riffs as heavy as anything metal was doing at the time.  I heard the album for the first time on the way to school with my brother who was big into all the grunge stuff, and I was stunned even at ten years old.  <BR><BR>

		For me, there’s something just below the surface with 'Dirt' that none of its contemporaries really offered at the time.  That’s not to say there weren’t other fantastic albums released in ’92.  I mean, hell, <strong>Burzum</strong> and <strong>Darkthrone</strong> released what are arguably the two premiere black metal albums.  I think 'Dirt' in many ways says a lot about where American heavy music was at the beginning of the 90s, and bands like Alice in Chains who kept at least part of their footing in heavy metal obviously influenced so many of the upcoming and already established metal bands releasing records today.  It’s for good reason, too.  <BR><BR>

		The same chills I got when I first heard those eerie vocals at the beginning of 'Would?' are still there over twenty years later no matter how many times I’ve listened. <BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong> <BR><BR>

		Ha!  Besides <strong>Rush’s</strong> 'Power Windows?'  I don’t know, man.  People are weird when it comes to this whole bandwagon hate or love thing.  Either extreme is counterproductive and shit talking takes little to no effort.  That said, when <strong>Mastodon’s</strong> 'The Hunter' came out in 2011, the “haters” or whatever came out in droves, man.  Holy hell.  You saw a little of it with 'Crack the Skye,' but when they pretty much abandoned the ridiculous storylines and concepts, a ton of fans abandoned ship.  That album is great, though.<BR><BR>

		No, it’s not as good as 'Leviathan' or 'Blood Mountain,' but it works and who honestly cares?  People shit all over that record because they played the comparative critic game which is utterly pointless yet somehow widely embraced.  I love that album because it’s a fun record to listen to that’s not soulless “party metal” or whatever that crap is.  I can just as readily listen to 'Black Tongue' or 'Stargasm' as I can anything on 'Remission.'  <BR><BR>

		I think a lot of fans were quick to dismiss it because they saw it as some drastic move from the band, but that’s on them for being lazy listeners.  If you listen to Mastodon’s two albums before 'The Hunter,' you can see that move coming a mile away.  But again, who cares?  If listeners want to constantly hold new records up next to previous efforts as some critical tool for determining viability, have fun with all of that.  I’ll be over here cranking 'Curl of the Burl' and totally fine with the fact that it’s not 'March of the Fire Ants.' <BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (back to 2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		(<strong>Swans</strong>) 'The Seer.'  Hands down.  By a mile.  Every time I listen to that record I get something new and something challenging.  It’s a masterpiece on several levels but one of the standout reasons for me is the fact that it shows a kind of entropy in sound – a sonic picture of the evolution from order to chaos, from beauty to ugliness.  I have no doubt that the years to come in music will only serve to place that album on a very short list of perfect releases from this era of music.  
<BR><BR>
		Michael Gira is the kind of lyricist and musician who demands attention not by putting on some spectacle or resorting to masturbatory composition but by this slow kind of abrasion.  That album eats at you and really never finishes even after you’re done listening.  <BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong><BR><BR>

		For whatever reason, I had never listened to (<strong>Megadeth's</strong>) 'Countdown to Extinction' until 2010.  It wasn’t a deliberate listening omission or anything.  I think it was one of those deals where I kept putting it off to listen to other things, and eventually just forgot about it.  <BR><BR>

		I love 'Rust in Peace,' and that’s an obvious classic itself, but 'Countdown to Extinction' was one of those that was maybe more meaningful or at least memorable to me simply because I was so late to the game listening to it.  For all the crap that might get thrown at Mustaine, deserved and not, the guy made some of the best metal releases of that whole time period including those made by the decidedly more successful band who kicked him out.  I’ve listened to it a few more times since, and it absolutely kills.  Better late than never. <BR><BR>

			<strong>What&#039;s Karen Mann Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Sun, 27 Apr 2014<BR><BR>
						Karen Mann (<a href="https://twitter.com/mannsworld" target="_blank">@mannsworld</a>) writes about eateries and lodging in North Carolina, and writes a good deal about metal on her blog <a href="http://mannsworld.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Mann's World</a>. Karen has been answering metal trivia here on Skull Toaster for quite awhile, so I was stoked to discover what she's been listening to. <BR><BR>


		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		I could listen to <strong>Iron Maiden's</strong> 'The Number of the Beast' every single day for the rest of my life and never get tired of it, which is funny because when I encountered NWOBHM as a kid -- by reading Creem Magazine’s infamous 1980  “Heavy Metal” issue -- I was totally and completely into <strong>Judas Priest</strong>. In fact, when I was 16, I saw Priest in Greensboro Coliseum on the 'Screaming for Vengeance' tour (and had my tour program signed by Rob in the hotel lobby afterward). <BR><BR>

		I didn’t see Iron Maiden live until this past September! But as much as I may still love certain Judas Priest songs, there’s no 'Priest album I love as much as 'The Number of the Beast.' There’s really no way to describe how shocking and exciting this album was to me as a young girl growing up in a culturally and geographically isolated part of the North Carolina coast.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		I don’t think there’s one particular album, but I admit to totally loving <strong>L.A. Guns’</strong> 'The Ballad of Jayne.' <BR><BR>

		Other than that, I don’t have much use for hair metal. In fact, that song came out when I was in college and had more or less abandoned metal in favor of alternative rock, which definitely had more musical and lyrical substance as far as I was concerned. Eventually I met a group of kids who introduced me to <strong>Metallica</strong> and <strong>Slayer</strong>, and I started getting back into harder stuff.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		Two immediately spring to mind: <strong>Pallbearer’s</strong> 'Sorrow and Extinction' (2012) and <strong>Cough’s</strong> 'Ritual Abuse' (2010). <BR><BR>

		Pallbearer is the of the most unexpected and immediately engaging bands I’ve ever encountered, and I was literally in love with everything about them from the very first listen. I think I’m one of the few who actually finds their music uplifting, mostly due to Brett Campbell’s angelic vocals. <BR><BR>

		Cough grabbed me through their live shows, and I’ve been lucky to see them many times. I listen to both of these albums at least once a week.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong><BR><BR>

		I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I never got into <strong>Death</strong> until recently, and I’m really kicking myself for not paying attention to them with Chuck Schuldiner was alive and I could have actually seen them play.<BR><BR>

		Also, despite being a huge <strong>Carcass</strong> fan, I never really got into their early grind stuff. I always liked 'Exhume to Consume' and 'Embryonic Necropsy and Devourment' as songs, but they were more or less exceptions. <BR><BR>

		I <a href="http://mannsworld.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-decibel-tour-carcass-gorguts-more.html" target="_blank">saw them recently in Atlanta, GA</a> on the Decibel tour, and in order to prepare myself, I listened to their entire catalog back-to-back. I was really surprised by how fresh the early stuff still sounded. 'Heartwork,' on the other hand, now sounds pretty dated to me. <BR><BR>

			<strong>What&#039;s Allyson B. Crawford Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 05 May 2014 <BR><BR>


		This week Allyson B. Crawford (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/bringbackglam" target="_blank">@bringbackglam</a>) from <a href="http://bringbackglam.com" target="_blank">Bring Back Glam</a> shares her musical journey. Allyson was my go-to glam writer on Noisecreep, so you can imagine the awesomeness you'll discover below! <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong><BR><BR>

		Folks that reading <a href="http://bringbackglam.com" target="_blank">bringbackglam.com</a> regularly know that I love all sorts of music, and my wheelhouse is just as much classic rock as it is 80s big hair. My favorite album of all time is <strong>Aerosmith</strong> 'Rocks.' Still my favorite band, too. I think 'Rocks' is just about the perfect rock album. It has both heavy and melodic moments with stadium-anthem riffs. Plus the songs have held up for 3+ decades.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		Most of the stuff I like is openly mocked by music critics, which is fine by me! I'll never let a critic or some other known "expert" dictate what I like and what I don't. To that end, I absolutely love <strong>Nelson's</strong> debut 'After the Rain.' <BR><BR>

		The band gets slagged but the Nelson brothers have a real music pedigree and 'After the Rain' is basically pop metal genius. "(Can't Live Without Your) Love and Affection" is very special -- and if the song comes on anywhere in public, everyone I've observed still knows all the lyrics. I think that says something.<BR><BR>


		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		Hands down, 'Digital Renegade' by <strong>I See Stars</strong>. Easily my favorite album of the last five years. Followed closely behind is <strong>Asking Alexandria's</strong> 'Stand Up and Scream.' 'The Final Episode' is a brilliant metalcore track. <BR><BR>

		I think both albums hold a special place in my heart because I used both to successfully train for my first half marathon. Anyone that is learning how to run for the first time knows how hard it can be -- having some pounding music made all the difference for me. <BR><BR>

		Plus I think metalcore - or electronic hardcore in the case of I See Stars - is the next logical evolution of metal. Adding electronic dance elements to metal tracks allows bands to widen their audience and that's just key for financial survival these days. After all, there's no shame in making a living off art.<BR><BR>


		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong><BR><BR>

		Probably early <strong>Metallica</strong>, 'Kill 'Em All.' I was never a fan of Metallica until '...And Justice for All,' but for whatever reason, I never went to the band's earlier albums until I was much older. Now I compare the early Metallica to the current tracks and I get why people call those first years the band's most important in terms of metal and legacy.<BR><BR>

			<strong>What&#039;s Jacob Frebe Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 12 May 2014<BR><BR>

Jacob Frebe (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jfrebe" target="_blank">@jfrebe</a>) is a relative newcomer to the Skull Toaster community, but his wit and charm has found a place in my metal heart. <BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> <BR><BR>

		After all these years? Well, all 20 years of my life I've covered a lot of music. I started listening to metal when I was 12, at first it was stuff like <strong>Trivium</strong> and <strong>Lamb of God</strong>. Then quickly turned into <strong>Death</strong>, <strong>Cannibal Corpse</strong>, and <strong>Slayer</strong>. I liked the imagery of them. But one night, while I was looking for something new to listen to on the internet (Something I still do today) I read about this genre called "Black Metal."<BR><BR>

		Frankly, it scared the shit out of me; murders, burnings, Satan, it was all too much for me. Well, when I turned 14 I had explored a lot more music, and again I ran into this genre. Well, a bit of research and the general consensus was that 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' by <strong>Burzum</strong> was "the best". So I listened to that. It was the first time in my life that music had really made me feel alone, cold, depressed, all the things that black metal is and wants to be, I felt. I just recently scrounged up enough money to buy the record version, re-pressed unfortunately, but what are you going to do? I've listened to the album so much, but still certain parts give me chills. It's just, overall, my favorite album to listen to when I'm alone.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong><BR><BR>

		I don't think I can think of an album that hasn't been ridiculed, but a specific one that I enjoy? That's a tough one. I just recently started listening to this band called <strong>The Myriad Burial</strong>, and the EP starts off with a bong rip, followed by a few guitar solos. That's it. I ridicule it, but I love it so much. Deathcore gets a lot of flak in general, and I'm no exception to that crowd. Most of it is unimaginative, breakdown-centric, and overall not too much variation. But yeah, 'Demo 2010' by the Myriad Burial.<BR><BR>

		I suppose, also, my undisputed love for <strong>Iwrestledabearonce</strong>. They're just everywhere and they change so much and use so many different motifs and styles, I can't help but love them. They get a lot of flak for not being a "real" grindcore band, but no one can ever describe them any better. My first metal shirt was an IWABO shirt that said "Metal Just Got Gay" in rainbow letters. Perfect.<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong><BR><BR>

		2009 was my freshman year of high school, and my music taste has evolved a lot since then. But even though it was two years after its release, it really stuck with the whole 'Fight Club' ideology I had going on at the time, <strong>Shining's</strong> 'V - Halmstad.'<BR><BR>

		Kvarforth is one of those vocalists I just can't forget, he's gone a unique way of shaping his voice to do exactly what he wants to, and I still can't get over this album. <BR><BR>

		This was also the time in my life when I started reading about Existentialism, and so I was looking for more and more depressive music and I stumbled across Shining. 14 year old pro-anarchy, somewhat understanding existentialism and some metaphysics, Jake LOVED this. And it reminds me of a time when things weren't actually so bad, and the music is still just really solid. Some people don't care for Kvarforth because of his antics, and he treats his fans like shit, but as my friend and fellow writer Jonathan Dick of Steel for Brains and I discussed once on twitter, art does not make the artist.<BR><BR>

		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		As bad as this sound, I was never a big <strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong> fan. I came into metal in the mid-2000's, and <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> (with Ozzy) wasn't as big then. 
<BR><BR>
		It took me until this year, 2014, to finally pick up 'Black Sabbath' by Black Sabbath, and listen to it. And I have no idea why it took me so long to do so. Black Sabbath is a wonderful band, and as far as first albums go, this is spectacular. 
<BR><BR>
		To me, Black Sabbath always was with Dio. Why? Black Sabbath is always called the Grandfather of heavy metal, and to me, Dio is the voice of heavy metal. So, Dio with Black Sabbath was what I listened to. But you can only go so long without listening to a classic such as that, and then I finally did and I really enjoyed myself. It deserves to be a classic.

		<strong>What&#039;s Renee Trotier Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Sun, 18 May 2014<BR><BR>

		Renee Trotier (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/metalrenee" target="_blank">@metalrenee</a>) writes for <a href="http://Hellbound.ca" target="_blank">Hellbound.ca</a> and she's a rad part of the nerdy Skull Toaster crowd. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Believe it or not, there aren't a whole lot of albums from my formative metal years that I can still put on today and be totally blown away by. Granted, my formative years weren't exactly a time when good metal was ripe for the picking. I bore witness to the rampant spread of nu-metal and the eventual takeover of metalcore, and I hopped right on the heavy metal train with albums like 'Iowa' by <strong>Slipknot</strong>. 
<BR><BR>

		It's safe to say that those albums don't see much rotation during my personal listening time these days. If there was an album that helped to inform and influence a transition into the darker depths of extreme metal it would probably be 'Blood Mountain' by <strong>Mastodon</strong>. 
<BR><BR>

		That album sounded like nothing I had ever heard at the time, it was so creative and progressive yet totally heavy. I still listen to it and love it just as much now. I owe a lot to Mastodon.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Based on willingness to divulge a past love of nu-metal, I obviously have no shame. Honestly though, music is a subjective medium and as such we are all going to experience it differently. I think it's silly to dismiss a particular band, or song, or album that speaks to you as an individual just because the collective masses might have a differing opinion. I still enjoy <strong>Mudvayne's</strong> 'The End of All Things To Come' because they are THE band that first introduced me to metal. 
<BR><BR>

		I also enjoy a ton of non-metal bands, stuff like <strong>The Philosopher Kings</strong> 'Famous, Rich and Beautiful'  and <strong>Blue Rodeo's</strong> 'Five Days in July'. Those are two albums that will stay with me for life. I grew up listening to blues and country so those stylistic elements always speak to me when they show up in any genre of music, be it metal or pop or weirdo acoustic indie rock.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		There have been so many amazing albums birthed within the past five years that it's difficult to know where to begin. Despite the marketplace saturation of vintage souding rock bands, I don't think I will ever get tired of hearing <strong>Graveyard's</strong> 'Hisingen Blues.' 

<BR><BR>
		It's one of those albums that just spoke to me the first time I heard it. It made me long for the comforts of home - a place where my father would rave about <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong> and crank blues while drinking in the garage on warm summer nights. I took to it immediately and haven't stopped listening since.
<BR><BR>
		Of course, there's a ton of stuff that's come out even more recently that I haven't stopped playing since I've heard it. Stuff like <strong>Wild Throne's</strong> EP 'Blood Maker' that came out earlier this year, last year's 'Dawning' by <strong>Mouth of the Architect</strong>, and everything Thrawsunblat has ever released. Of course, <strong>Skeletonwitch's</strong> 'Breathing the Fire' came out 5 years ago and it remains one of my favourite 'Witch albums to date.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I didn't grow up in that golden age of metal, so the closest I got to enjoying so-called classic albums was <strong>Metallica's</strong> 'Master of Puppets' and <strong>Slayer's</strong> 'Reign In Blood'. By the time I really got into metal, YouTube and Myspace were making it easy to search and find new music from around the world, so I didn't spend much time exploring the classics as much as I probably should have. Modern metal has taken influences from all the originators and expanded to the point that it's almost difficult to go back and listen to those older bands. That being said, I've been known to play Black Sabbath's 'Heaven and Hell' on repeat every now and again. If I wasn't the most hated metal head on the internet before this questionnaire, I certainly am now. Ha!

				Mon, 26 May 2014<BR><BR>

		Justin Petrick (<a href="https://twitter.com/IC_Heavy" target="_blank">@IC_Heavy</a>) writes for <a href="http://echoesanddust.com/" target="_blank">Echoes and Dust</a> and <a href="http://metalbandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Metal BandCamp</a>. He's been a jovial part of @skulltoaster for some time, so I'm stoked to share his musical journey. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		As I was fortunate enough to grow up during Heavy Metal’s original Heyday (translate: I am old), there are a great deal of albums I listen to from those days that have a special place in my heart. However there are very few that give me chills like two albums in particular do: <strong>Slayer’s</strong> 'South of Heaven' and <strong>King Diamond’s</strong> 'Them.' 
<BR><BR>

		Both albums are important to metal and to how my tastes in metal progressed and evolved but if I had to choose between the two it would probably be 'Them.' The way this album is put together and the cohesive-ness of the story and the music is just something that transported me to another world.  King Diamond’s ability to create such a spectacular story and just grab the listener from the first notes is truly something that I had never experienced before in music. Sure, <strong>Alice Cooper</strong> had the shock rock thing down pat and he would create stories within his act, and I truly love Alice, but something about King and his story telling just stuck with me like nothing before.
<BR><BR>
		'Them' was my first King Diamond album and from there I started to find out everything I could about the man and the band. Remember kids, this was before the Internet so it was a lot of looking through metal mags and trying to find interviews and features, anything I could get my hands on at the time. This research of course led back to the albums 'Abigail' and 'Fatal Portrait' and of course this also led to the discovery of <strong>Mercyful Fate</strong>. But the fact is every time I play Them it takes me back to that day in a little record store in New Carrollton, Maryland where I discovered King and he opened a whole new world of Heavy Metal to me.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		This is a funny question because the answer is “How about everything I enjoy!” Seriously though, I am in my 40s, a professional and the only one in my family and friends that listen to metal. I have plenty of friends in Pittsburgh, PA who I grew up with and am still best friends with who still listen to metal, but the people around me now, whether it is family or friends, are not people who enjoy listening to my music.
<BR><BR>
		It is an interesting dynamic because I do not in any way hide my affinity for metal but when I am asked about music I like I always get the same uneasy look. Of course then I get, “yeah, I like 'The Black Album,' too!” like most of us metal heads get when we talk to others about the music we love. 
<BR><BR>
		This is one of the reasons I love Twitter so much as most of my friends and acquaintances are metal heads like me and I can have honest conversations about the music I love and that has brought so much happiness to my life. Plus there are so many people on Twitter to talk to about metal and they all have their favorite bands and styles and sub-genres that there is not any time for ridicule. Most of us are too busy talking about the stuff that we love to worry about being a dick to someone else. 
<BR><BR>
		I am absolutely sure that there are things I listen to that other metal heads would give me crap for and I am sure I would do the same but overall it is mostly the people who have never listened to the genre or even tried to understand it that are the biggest asses.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Woods of Ypres</strong> 'Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light' from 2012 is a three times a week listen for me. The beauty and pain of these songs keeps me coming back again and again; I truly can’t stop listening to this album. 
<BR><BR>

		What David Gold was able to create and the story that he tells and the eventual circumstances behind his death and the album’s release are chilling. The first time I heard this album I had no idea who Woods of Ypres where, or what kind of band they were but when I heard the beautiful combination of David Gold’s voice, the music, and the narrative I fell in love with this album. 
<BR><BR>
		'<a href="http://rd.io/x/QEZ0K6_R2Q/" target="_blank">Traveling Alone</a>' has become a favorite song for me from this album or any other album for that matter. The beauty, sadness, and understanding in this song is the type of thought provoking thing that haters of metal never hear or understand. If there is one thing I would tell anybody who listens to metal or even has an interest, it is to listen to this album and understand how magical and beautiful metal can really be and that even at its most extreme there is a wonderful feel and beauty to this music. 'Woods 5' is a fine example of this and has and will stay with me for a long time to come.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I guess this answer really depends on your idea of “classic” but for me it is <strong>Entombed’s</strong> 'Wolverine Blues.'
<BR><BR>
		Like I said it just depends on your idea of classic but as I was never really a death metal fan, I never really listened to this album or any Entombed for that matter. It was just recently that I was introduced to this band and when I heard this album I was instantly hooked. 
<BR><BR>
		There is something different about this album that I find a bit more accessible than other death metal albums out there today. I don’t know if it is the vocals, which I find to be more annunciated than most death metal or the speed and rhythm but something about what Entombed does really works for me. 
<BR><BR>
		The 1990’s were a time in my life when I was not able to access metal as much as I would have liked. I was stationed on Puerto Rico during my time in the US Coast Guard and access to music was via a Navy Exchange, as you can imagine there wasn’t a lot of death metal available. So I have had to go back a lot to the 1990’s and revisit the music that was released during that decade, as I have done so I have found a few gems but nothing stands out to me like 'Wolverine Blues' because it was an album that surprised me and I had no idea I would like it as much as I do. It certainly goes to show you that you should try and give everything a chance even if it is outside of your comfort zone.

				Mon, 07 Jul 2014<BR><BR>

		Bruce Fraser (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/BruceFraser" target="_blank">@BruceFraser</a>) lives in the province of Nova Scotia, on Canada's East Coast. Bruce is an upstanding citizen of the metal twittersphere, and answerer of many Skull Toaster trivia questions each week! 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		I'm getting old. I can feel it in my joints. I was a teen in the 80s but I still vividly remember my first music purchase with my own money. I was 12 or 13, flipping through the LPs at the mall’s shifty looking music store, and I came across Eddie poised for attack on the cover of <strong>Iron Maiden's</strong> 'Maiden Japan.' I didn’t have a clue what it sounded like, but I needed to have it. That was my first music purchase and I was a massive Maiden fan for years after. 
<BR><BR>
		Because of that, an older friend recommended I check out <strong>Fates Warning</strong>. He thought they sounded the same.  They don't, but I checked them out anyway. The album 'Spectre Within' has become one of my all time favorites. I listened to it constantly over the summer of 1985. 
<BR><BR>
		At the time I was also reading Gene Wolfe's 'Book of the New Sun' series (highly recommended, by the way) and the music and the stories became intricately linked. Whenever I listen to that album, all of Wolfe's rich characters come back to life for me, even though the music has nothing to do with the novels. 
<BR><BR>
		John Arch's vocals are divisive, as are Ray Alder's. But to me, Arch’s Fates Warning defined the 80’s early progressive metal. Arch and Matheos recently collaborated again and put out the album 'Sympathetic Resonance.' It's like Fate's Warning just skipped forward 25 years without missing a beat. Wicked.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Guns 'N Roses</strong>, 'Chinese Democracy.' I LOVE every second of this album and it is almost universally panned by critics. The lyrics, vocals, insanely good guitar work by Buckethead, Bumblefoot and Robin Finck all combine together to make a different soundscape that even rivals Use Your Illusion I & II. 
<BR><BR>
		The band is, of course, a massive cluster, but that album really is good. Twenty years in the making good? Well I don't know, but it sure is fun to listen to. 
<BR><BR>
		Good god. That guitar work in 'This I Love.' 
<BR><BR>
		My musical tastes are dubious. I also love <strong>Poison's</strong>, 'Look What The Cat Dragged In' and <strong>As I Lay Dying's</strong>, 'An Ocean Between Us.' Yeah, I know. Lambesis is a degenerate fool. 
<BR><BR>
		Funny thing; throw on Poison when you’re in the car with your buddies, and EVERYBODY knows the lyrics.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		I joined twitter in 2009. I had been using Facebook for a while by then and I wasn't sure what to make of this new medium. I quickly found a good community of like-minded metal fans and I became exposed to a huge new resource for music and interaction.  
<BR><BR>
		One of the first new bands that caught my ear was <strong>Alpinist</strong>. The album 'minus.mensch' came out in May that year and, man, I was hooked. That album is a goddamn frenetic masterpiece. 
<BR><BR>
		The last track, 'Outro.' So layered and beautiful. 
<BR><BR>
		I specifically remember when I ordered the album; (band member) Hendrick himself emailed me to say thanks and included digital versions of their other albums. Such a nice guy. This had not happened to me before. The exposure to great music, and the ability to interact with the bands making it, was an exciting combination. 
<BR><BR>
		I was so disappointed when they split in 2012, but glad to see that 3/4 of the band continued on by forming <strong><a href="http://jungbluth.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Jungbluth</a></strong>.   
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Cirith Ungol</strong>, 'King of the Dead.' Other than the track 'Death of the Sun' on an 80s Metal Blade 'Metal Massacre' compilation, I never really listened to Cirith Ungol. I really should have paid more attention to them back then and I've recently started listening to them a lot. 
<BR><BR>
		I seem to have a thing for odd vocal styles. Tim Baker's electric shrieks captivate me.  '<a href="http://rd.io/x/QEZ0K15Gmg/" target="_blank">Finger of Scorn</a>' is a great example.

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Thin Lizzy</strong> have managed to drill massive boreholes into my heart and build a sizable home there. With that said, I’m fairly certain that the 'Jailbreak' LP will always give me chills. From start to finish it is without a doubt a complete masterpiece. You know how most people have vivid memories of where they where when something  really good, really bad, or really monumental happened? Well I can remember where I was when I heard Thin Lizzy for the first time, and the album was 'Jailbreak.'
<BR><BR>
		It was love at first sight in sound form. I remember thinking to myself, "This shit is amazing!! Where has it been all my life?” Every single song on the album  is perfection. From ‘Jailbreak’ as the opener to ‘Emerald’ (my all time favorite Thin Lizzy song), which closes the album, the whole LP is faultless. As soon as I heard it I hit the search engines to begin digging up anything and everything I could find on Thin Lizzy. Years later and I have become that girl who celebrates Phil Lynott’s birthday regardless of never having known him in real life. (I made "whiskey in the jar" chocolate cakes last year). I’m the girl who always feels a strong sadness on his death anniversary. 
<BR><BR>
		Over the years I have slowly but surely built an “anything and everything” I can get my hands on collection of Thin Lizzy albums and memorabilia. I’ve also chosen to carry them with me via back patch form on my vest so they can ride along with me wherever I go. I guess you could say they’ll always ride shotgun when it comes to playing favorites. If you don’t already, make it a point to get a hefty serving of Thin Lizzy in your diet.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		We talking ridiculed metal albums here or guilty pleasure albums? I’ve always been a mixed bag when it comes to music. As I’ve gotten older I’ve embraced that more and more by the day. It’s not uncommon for me to listen to <strong>Iron Maiden</strong>, <strong>Daughter</strong> or <strong>R.L. Burnside</strong> on the same day. I’m an incredibly huge <strong>Prince</strong> fan. I’ve always gotten shit for liking <strong>Faith No More</strong> (any album). 
<BR><BR>
		I’ve also gotten a fair amount of shit for liking; scratch that, LOVING <strong>Dokken</strong>, 'Under Lock and Key.' 
<BR><BR>
		To switch the question up a little bit... as far as bands that are typically loved and adored that I absolutely cannot stand, <strong>Pantera</strong> immediately comes to mind. I’ve tried over and over to get into them, (seeing as they are a staple in the metal universe) but I just can’t. Not my bag at all.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		It only came out last year but the 'Manifest Decimation' LP by <strong>Power Trip</strong> is always in constant rotation for me and I can’t imagine that changing anytime soon. 
<BR><BR>
		I’m still kicking myself for being under the weather when they came to town (Arizona). I hope I can catch their live set somewhere sometime soon. 'Manifest Decimation' is just so energetic and violent. It doesn’t matter what mood I’m in, any song on that album has a way of getting my blood moving at maximum speed, and that’s invaluable. If you haven’t heard ‘em yet... grab the album and blast ‘Conditioned to Death’ until your brain evacuates from your skull. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		I’m trying to think long and hard on this one. I’ve always listened to primarily old school or “classic” metal so I dug deep when I was first getting into it. It was like a fast developing drug problem when I first got hooked in high school. I can remember sitting on the computer or browsing record stores looking for any and every album I could get my hands on. I was (and still am) hell-bent on having an A – Z complete collection of the classic stuff, I’m always looking for something I may have missed. 
<BR><BR>
		I guess if I had to pick anything I could say I missed the boat on would be <strong>Accept</strong>. I had been listening to all the classics for years and remember seeing Accept albums but hadn’t ever taken the time to listen to them. Once I did I was blow away. To this day Accept’s 'Staying a Life' is my all time favorite live album. I kicked myself for all the years I went without giving them a solid listen. They’re now a permanent fixture in my collection and a band that I spin constantly. Guess it’s my “metal heart” that calls me to them. (I’m lame).

		Aaron Hutchison (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/getxstoked" target="_blank">@getxstoked</a>) books shows at the <a href="breathingroomPA.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Breathing Room</a>, works in a cubicle, and answers metal trivia here on Skull Toaster on the regular. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
		<strong>Zao</strong>, 'Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest,' I saw them not long after the line up that recorded this album came together, and when they played 'A Fall Farewell' and 'To Think of You Is to Treasure An Absent Memory' the whole hardcore thing clicked for me. Like I'm not the only one going through these things in my life.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
		Since this is for a metal site, I assume that my love of <strong>New Found Glory's</strong> 'Radiosurgery' would probably get me mocked...and <strong>It Dies Today's</strong> 'The Caitiff Choir' for other segments of the audience haha.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		I still find myself going back to <strong>Ruiner's</strong> 'Hell is Empty' record pretty often, just a great emotional hardcore album, without being overdramatic emo or what have you. Their last show in 2010 was amazing as well. And for more current bands, I've been really loving the <strong>Torn</strong> demo lately, can't wait for the 7" of it to drop on Harm Reduction.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		It took me several years to come around to <strong>Pantera</strong>, because of the typical Pantera fans I went to high school with, but a few years ago, I finally sat down and listened to 'Cowboys From Hell' and 'Far Beyond Driven' back to back and realized how many of my favorite bands straight up stole their riffs from Dime.

						<strong>What&#039;s Daniela Patrizi Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 17 Jun 2014
				<BR><BR>

		Daniela Patrizi (<a href="https://twitter.com/DaniDaniPat" target="_blank">@DaniDaniPat</a>) writes for Echoes and Dust and often tweets about music, so I knew I needed to feature her here! 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		To pick up only one album after all these years is a difficult exercise; I always simply cannot answer to  questions like this one. I even don’t have a favorite song, it’s impossible if you are a music lover. It mostly  depends on my mood so I can go from <strong>Joy Division</strong> to <strong>Neurosis</strong> to <strong>Sigur Ros</strong> to <strong>Isis</strong> (you know that I could continue, don't you?). Music soldiers that read <a href="http://echoesanddust.com" target="_blank">echoesanddust.com</a> know that I'm not stuck on one music genre only.
<BR><BR>
		But if I have to choose a specific record my post rocker soul would pick 'Spiderland' by <strong>Slint</strong> that is just a perfect album. That album reminds me memories of the beginning of the 90s. 'Spiderland' changed my approach to music and after finding that album I started diving into the music scene of the previous years. I saw them playing live two weeks ago at Primavera Sound in Barcelona; it was one of the best experience I have ever had, not only for the performance, but for the flashbacks I had. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		That’s a tough question! I think I’ve a list of album that can result ridiculous. I grew up in the 80s and my family, especially my sister that has a terrible taste in music, used to listen mostly to pop music. Well, the <strong>Garbage’s</strong> self titled debut album is one I remember with affection and sometime, this is really embarrassing, I listen to it on vinyl! It's terrible, I'm conscious about that.
<BR><BR>
		I grew up in the countryside and when I was a teenager I used to go to a river close to my house with my friends almost every afternoon. There was a bar on the river and that album was always on. Listening to it now brings me to the past, sometimes it evokes the flavor and the sounds of those afternoons. This is the power of music: it brings you back to the past, makes you hope for the future and it makes you live intensively your present. Going back to that Garbage's record....well, I still remember its words!
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		This is another tough question. Luckily the last five years were full of good albums I always bring with me. 
<BR><BR>
		Thinking as a post metal lover I choose 'Wavering Radiant' (2009) by Isis. Consider that Isis is one of my favorite bands and ‘Wavering Radiant’ is a record I have been listening a lot recently. My favorite from them is In the 'Absence of Truth' even if 'Wavering Radiant' signs a step ahead for the band in their expressive musical personalities as well as their concepts. 
<BR><BR>
		'Empros' (2011) by <strong>Russian Circles</strong> is another one I listen to regularly, like a therapy. Each time I have a new vinyl in my hands I am like a child in front of Disneyland and when I start playing I immediately transfer myself into another world. Music often works as an escape for me and it helps me to live in my world rather than participating anything else that surrounds me. When I find an album I like, I listen to it on repeatedly and I annoy all the people around forcing them in listening to it. I did the same with ISIS’s records and I think that my friends now are exhausted. I become an asshole, a nice one, but always an asshole.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		Absolutely, yes! My metal background is not so strong and, this could be another embarrassing moment, but only five-six years ago I discovered that ‘Black Sabbath’ by <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> is a masterpiece.
<BR><BR>
		I've always noticed it before but I never gave it a spin. When I finally did it I blamed myself for that unforgivable delay. Better than never. Entirely heavy and very well structured, this album is gigantic. They’re now a constant in my playlist and I spin them regularly. 
<BR><BR>
		Thanks to my beloved friend Sander van den Driesche I recently approached the world of <strong>Amenra</strong> and I’ll never thank him enough for that. The level of depth they are able to achieve is incredible. I love heavy music and I love it most when it makes me sad cause I feel it closer to me. It's a matter of intimacy and that sensation is a drug. Music is my addiction.

		<strong>What&#039;s Erik Highter Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 23 Jun 2014
<BR><BR>
		Erik Highter (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/EZSnappin" target="_blank">@EZSnappin</a>) is a New Englander living in Dallas, TX. When Erik isn't answering 89% of the metal trivia on Skull Toaster, he writes for <a href="http://lastrit.es/" target="_blank">Last Rites</a>, <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/archive/contributor/1010/" target="_blank">PopMatters</a>, and <a href="http://www.steelforbrains.com/" target="_blank">Steel for Brains</a>. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		So many possibilities! Picking just one for any of these questions is a brutal task. After some careful consideration, I have to say it's Black Sabbath's self-titled debut. Those first resonant notes still bring goosebumps to my arms and a chill up my spine. So much has been written about the music on this record that there is nothing I could possibly add; instead, let me take a moment to tell the tale of how and when I was introduced to the album.
<BR><BR>
		I have a cousin who is around five years older than myself, and we were (and in most ways, still are) the black sheep of the extended Highter clan. One day, it must have been 1979 or '80, I remember he and I hiding from our families in his room. On the wall were posters of a live Hendrix photo and the Physical Graffiti cover. I asked about them, and he queued up 'Are You Experienced?' and then the <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong>. I was blown away.
<BR><BR>
		My positive response to those records led him to pull out a weird looking record that featured a grainy photograph of some orange-tinted riverside with a figure in black. To be honest, it didn't look that promising. Little did I know what was in store. The rain sounds at first seemed innocuous, not the ominous storm it's been ever since. Then those first three notes hit and I was shook. I held the album jacket in my hands, and it was bigger than my chest. I looked. I listened. By the time the song was done I was trembling and my cousin lifted the needle. I shook my head, he put it back down, and we listened to the rest of the record. I don't think I said anything while it was playing or after it was done. I liked Hendrix and Zep, but I wasn't ready for <strong>Black Sabbath</strong>. I had no way to process what I heard.
<BR><BR>
		I was six, or maybe barely seven.
<BR><BR>
		It was three or four years before I heard it again, but the goosebumps were there immediately. Sabbath, man. Sabbath.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I've come to despise the idea of guilty pleasures. It devalues your own emotional response while reinforcing the worst behavior of crowds. Like what you like, despise what you despise, and let others do the same. I know that's not how the world works, and I'm a hypocrite because on occasion I'll raise an eyebrow and spout off about other people's tastes (see, <strong>Deafheaven</strong>). Still, in an ideal world I wouldn't give a crap and neither would anyone else. 
<BR><BR>
		All that said, I love lots of stuff looked down on by the masses. In fact, since I'm telling tales from my childhood, I'll talk about my continued love for the first record I ever bought with my own money: <strong>Men At Work's</strong> 'Business As Usual.' 
<BR><BR>
		The hits have lived on as early 80s classics, but the album was much more than 'Down Under', 'Who Can It Be Now?' and 'Be Good Johnny'. It's the deep cuts that didn't sound like the Aussie version of <strong>The Police</strong>; 'Underground', 'Down By The Sea' and particularly the oddly frenetic 'Helpless Automaton' are all equal to the hits without a whiff of cod-reggae. 'Helpless Automaton' was my favorite on first listen and still holds that place. It's like <strong>Split Enz</strong> covering <strong>The Cars</strong>, or vice versa. I can't decide.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		Once a record becomes a favorite I find it hard not to make space for it in the rotation. It's one of the reasons I listen to less new music than most of my peers; the other main one being I'm old and curmudgeonly, and won't sit through something if it doesn't hook me in some way pretty damn quick. 
<BR><BR>
		However, one record springs immediately to mind: <strong>Kowloon Walled City's</strong> 'Container Ships.' It's a record that grabbed me immediately, though not with the music but with the sound of the recording. Scott Evans handled the recording and the mix, and it's one of the most vivid and visceral recordings in my collection. The instruments are given space to claim as their own, with a great, spacious room sound that is both booming and tight. I've tried several times over the few years since its release to get what I hear down on paper, and in my estimation I've failed every time. 
<BR><BR>
		I think it's because my understanding and focus changes with each spin. I keep hearing new things, both in the recordings and compositions, that lead my mind down a different path and a different understanding. Every record contains layers and sounds that open over time, but 'Container Ships' seems endless. It still has secrets it has yet to divulge after dozens and dozens of plays.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Again, how to choose? I took a sabbatical from metal from roughly 1993-2005. I was disappointed with the rise of death metal and what became groove metal, doom seemed dead, and I was drawn more to noise and industrial music for my heavy fix. So upon my return to the fold I had both classic albums and whole genres to discover. I knew <strong>Venom</strong> and <strong>Bathory</strong> and <strong>Celtic Frost</strong>, but their progeny were a mystery. I knew <strong>Death</strong> and <strong>Cannibal Corpse</strong> and <strong>Carcass</strong>, but had no idea what paths they and others had chosen to follow.
<BR><BR>
		I'm still filling in gaps. However, a friend who knew my tastes ran more to the experimental than the orthodox handed me a copy of <strong>Gorgut's</strong> 'Obscura' not long after I started on the road back into metal. I was stunned. The opening 30 seconds of the title track clicked immediately; I told my friend, "This is <strong>Mr. Bungle</strong> death metal!" and he nodded, as if saying, "I know." This didn't seem unapproachable or difficult at all, and I'm still confused by that assessment of it by a lot of folks. I guess backing into it from decades spent with noise, free jazz, improv and the like made it easier. Regardless, I've loved it since that day in 2006.

			<strong>What&#039;s Caryn Havlik Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 30 Jun 2014
				<BR><BR>

		Mortals' drummer Caryn Havlik (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/caryn_aych" target="_blank">@caryn_aych</a>) and I started talking back in March, when I posted our first metal trivia question about her band (<a href="http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=da4c5383f10636bd2d5fb9e92&id=78727eecb2&e=b9cf3022be" target="_blank">question #1234</a>)! Since then she <a href="http://www.skulltoaster.com/2014/05/07/1320-cursed-to-see-the-future-is-a-full-length-studio-album-due-in-july-by-what-brooklyn-ny-band/">explained the meaning</a> behind Mortals' album title, 'Cursed to See the Future,' out July 8, 2014 on Relapse Records, and now Havlik talks a bit about the music she's been listening to over the years. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Robyn Hitchcock’s</strong>, 'Eye' (1990).  All grandpa's guitars and no drums at all crafted into surreal song ideas with utterly bizarre lyrics, with spoken-sung bits, and intervals of off-kilter upright bar piano. 
<BR><BR>
		I spent so much time with this record while I was on midday breaks from my very weird summer job at the Argonne National Labs working for a demented water chemist, and later for a cool soil microbiologist who schooled me about mescaline.  The music was the furthest that I could get from <strong>Ministry</strong>, <strong>NIN</strong>, and Wax Trax! Records.  
<BR><BR>
		Depending on a the song, you can feel all creeped out, or romantically moved, or suddenly compelled to giggle at Robyn’s lyric couplets; “I’m into you so far, I’m out the other side, and orbiting is just a waste of time.” I still love trying to sing along to capture his reedy, higher register and then match my voice down to the low, growling melodies.  
<BR><BR>
		Once, there was also a guitar-playing guy who charmed me by playing the instrumental track, 'Chinese Water Python,' while walking around his apartment without pants. The pleading, “Oh and I’ll sculpt you,” from 'Queen Elvis,' rarely fails to get me to tear up at awkward moments, just overwhelming me with feelings.  This is the only music I’ve ever tried to play on guitar (and failed.) Standout tunes for me are 'Queen Elvis,' 'Glass Hotel,' and 'Flesh Cartoon,' 'Raining Twilight Coast,' and the ebullient and folky love song, 'Beautiful Girl.'
<BR><BR>
		Sidenote; I’ve been stalking Robyn Hitchcock for years and nearly got his signature on my arm as a tattoo.  It’s the only tattoo I’ve ever even considered.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		Just about everything that I listen to is ridiculed when it is my turn to DJ in the van.  I think that all of their teeth grind involuntarily when I put on the Romanian gypsy band, <strong>Fanfare Ciocarlia</strong>. I highly recommend Fanfare’s record with another great Balkan Brass Band, <strong>Boban & Marko Markovic Orchestra</strong>, 'Balkan Brass Battle.'
<BR><BR>
		It’s just the most energetic crazy stuff, full of riffs - these dudes are literally playing with the technical skill of speed metallers, albeit on brass instruments.   Possibly most disturbing to the fellow travelers might be my chair-dancing and bouncing that involuntarily happens while listening.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Kylesa’s</strong> 'Static Tensions.'  The rest of Mortals had been into Kylesa way before me, so I figured I might give this album a try. 
<BR><BR>
		This was the record for me! It had many months of heavy rotation. Our bass player Lesley and I went to see them for that tour at the now-closed Maxwell’s in New Jersey, and headbanged up close to Phillip & Laura, hopefully intimidating most of those around us by screaming along and eating our hair while swirling it. That show was a really good time! The record is still a powerful serving of double-drumming assault, well-coordinated riff-trading, and scream-able, fist-pumping lyrics and when it comes on my gym playlist, I get all pumped. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		That would be <strong>Black Sabbath’s</strong> 'Paranoid.'  I had too much hair metal as I was growing up in my teens, and then got big and strong on a steady diet of industrial music.  I missed out on most classic metal until I was OLD.
<BR><BR>
		I was really skeptical for so many years. I thought that 'Iron Man' was tired, and never got it.  While a captive audience on a road trip to the beach, almost 10 years ago, I was guided through the record, and still blasphemously scoffed at the dead drum sounds of the 1970’s.  
<BR><BR>
		But after we got past 'Iron Man,' I grudgingly came around to the fact that there is so much riffage going on here, drum-wise from Bill Ward, and his nutso solos on 'Rat Salad,' and then of course, the most obvious guitar wizardry from Iommi & Butler in combination with Ozzy in peak trippy and scary form singing and wailing. Even though the record was released before the age of all sounds being pushed to 11 for listening, it feels in-your-face and punishing, while still pulsing with groove.  
<BR><BR>

			<strong>What&#039;s Caroline Harrison Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 14 Jul 2014<BR><BR>

		Caroline Harrison (@carolinedraws) is an fantastic artist and photographer; her photos have graced Brooklyn Vegan and Invisible Oranges, and she <a href="www.cargocollective.com/carolinedraws" target="_blank">recently did the album art</a> for 'The Mother of Virtues,' by <strong>Pyrrhon</strong>. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		It took me a while to really latch on to the album format. Since I started REALLY listening to music in the era of Limewire and Kazaa, finding full albums was pretty time-consuming. I was mostly hunting for music on my brother's computer, since it was the only one in the house that was able to handle MP3s. He would have killed me if he'd known I was in his room, so I had to limit my downloading to times when I knew he'd be out of the house. I listened to a lot of hastily burned mix CDs, often made up of tracks I knew from the local classic rock station, or tracks that had certain key words in the title. Things like "punk" and "rain" were popular search terms. Being fourteen is embarrassing. 
<BR><BR>
		My parents still had all of their old vinyl, so I started to "get it" when I discovered the <strong>Beatles</strong>. Listening to the second side of 'Abbey Road' over and over and over - you know, the songs that all run together — was one of the first moments when I really understood that albums weren't just a bunch of songs slapped together. When a friend gave a bunch of us access to his dad's friend's online MP3 server, I went completely crazy downloading stuff.
<BR><BR>
		Somewhere in all of this I downloaded 'Electro-Shock Blues' by <strong>Eels</strong>. Maybe a boy I had a crush on mentioned he liked Eels, maybe I remembered 'My Beloved Monster' from the 'Shrek' soundtrack, but my initial reason for downloading all the songs has been totally lost to the years, and it ultimately doesn't matter. The album, from start to finish, hurts. But at times it's also wickedly funny. E (Mark Oliver Everett, the main creative force behind Eels) wrote it largely in response to his sister's suicide and his mother's terminal lung cancer. I didn't know this until a few months ago when I finally bothered to look it up, but it makes sense. This album hurts — start to finish — but the pain is nuanced, and by the end of the album, it's focused and purposeful. Nothing feels unnecessary. 
<BR><BR>
		Other spectacular chill-inducing albums: 'OK Computer' by <strong>Radiohead</strong>, a flawless album, 'In the Aeroplane Over the Sea' by <strong>Neutral Milk Hotel</strong>, 'Endtroducing' by <strong>DJ Shadow</strong>, numerous albums by the <strong>Mountain Goats</strong>, 'Alopecia' by <strong>Why?</strong>, 'Inherited Scars' by <strong>Sage Francis</strong>, 'When the Pawn Hits' by <strong>Fiona Apple</strong>.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I'm wincing typing this, but I might as well be honest: I bought a copy of <strong>Dave Matthews Band</strong>, 'Live in Chicago, 12.19.98' when I was in 8th grade. 
<BR><BR>
		I played it all the time. It pains me to admit this, but I still absolutely adore tracks five and six on the first disc: '#40' to 'Lie In Our Graves.' I can't defend it. As much as I want to chalk it up to going to the prep schools where my parents taught or not knowing any better, I still kind of love those two tracks. Also tracks nine and 10 on disc one, 'Pantala Naga Pampa' into 'Rapunzel.' Disc two was weaker, but whatever, I might as well own the suckitude and embrace my shame.
<BR><BR>
		Also, 'What's the Story, Morning Glory?' by <strong>Oasis</strong>. But fuck the haters, that album rules.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		Oh man, there's been a ton of great music in the past five years. I'm still spinning <strong>Andrew Bird's</strong> 2012 record 'Break It Yourself' regularly, <strong>Fiona Apple's</strong> devastating 'The Idler Wheel...' (2012), <strong>Grinderman's</strong> 'Grinderman 2' (2010) receives super heavy rotation, <strong>KEN mode's</strong> 'Venerable' (2011), <strong>Unsane's</strong> 'Wreck' (2012). 
<BR><BR>
		Going back to the idea of albums that give you chills? <strong>Menomena's</strong> 2010 album 'Mines' still hits me right in the sternum. I loved the album after hearing it the first few times, but later that year I found myself returning to it when various people I knew passed away. 
<BR><BR>
		It's hard to explain exactly why I kept coming back to Mines. I think the tracks explain better than I ever could. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		You've probably figured it out by now, but I'm not exactly the queen of metal. I came to the genre pretty late, so I'm still getting my bearings and muddling my way through the classics. 'Master of Reality' (<strong>Black Sabbath</strong>, duh) is probably the first classic album that I was made to sit down and listen to, and it was absolutely amazing. 
<BR><BR>
		I've also been spinning <strong>Unsane's</strong> 'Scattered, Smothered, and Covered' a bunch recently though I guess that's less of a "classic?" Whatever you'd call it, it's catchy as all hell and I haven't been able to stop listening for over a year at this point. 
<BR><BR>
		The same thing happened when I picked up both 'Atomizer' and 'Songs About Fucking' by <strong>Big Black</strong>. I've been listening to those albums on and off since probably 2011, but I get something new out of almost every listen. I never really fixated on Bad Houses the first several listens through Atomizer, but something about it clicked in the last few months and now I can't stop playing it.
<BR><BR>
		I have SO MUCH to catch up on though—and since there's loads of good stuff coming out every month, I'm not sure I'll ever be totally caught up. I'm coming to terms with that though, and focusing on just enjoying the new musical experiences.

		<strong>What&#039;s Sanskar Wagley Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 21 Jul 2014 
<BR><BR>
		Sanskar Wagley (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/sanskarwagley" target="_blank">@sanskarwagley</a>) lives in Staten Island NY, is a Political Science major, and he answers a whole lot of questions here on Skull Toaster. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Between the Buried and Me</strong>, 'Colors' is probably my favorite album of all time. That album was definitely a turning point for me in my musical journey. At the time, I was still discovering different types of metal besides nu metal and metalcore, and 'Colors' had everything I wanted: dynamics, technicality, catchiness, and most of all, it wasn’t mainstream!
<BR><BR>
		Another album that has stuck with me for a long time is <strong>Gojira’s</strong> 'The Way of All Flesh,' one of those albums that I enjoy listening to top to bottom, and where every track gives me something new to fawn over, from the guitar tapped intro to 'Ouroboros' to the thundering double bass on 'Esoteric Surgery.'
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I’m not ashamed to say that I still enjoy some of the mainstream metalcore bands of the early-mid 2000s like <strong>Killswitch Engage</strong> and <strong>All That Remains</strong>, but one of my favorite records from that era that I find is highly underrated is <strong>I Killed the Prom Queen’s</strong>, 'Music for the Recently Deceased.' The Gothenburg (Sweden) scene influence is strong on this record, and it definitely makes for some great hooks.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		Pretty much any American black metal record from the past few years, like <strong>Nachtmystium's</strong> 'Addicts,' <strong>Krallice's</strong> 'Diotima,' and <strong>Wolves in the Throne Room's</strong> 'Celestial Lineage' has had heavy rotation, but <strong>Deafheaven's</strong> 'Sunbather' stands out the most. 
<BR><BR>
		This album has only been out for a year at this point, but that album has resonated with me so much. I loved 'Roads to Judah' when I first heard it back in 2011, but Sunbather went above and beyond my expectations, and I don’t think I’ve gotten bored of it yet.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		Hmmm, this is a tough one. This might surprise some people, but <strong>Metallica's</strong> self-titled (The Black Album). I used to shrug it off for not being as good as the previous records, but it stands on its own as a solid release. No surprise it’s the top selling album of the Soundscan era, because I think it makes for the perfect intro to metal album: heavy without being too fast, more hard-rock leaning, and the most adventurous writing Metallica could muster for 1991.

		<strong>What&#039;s Dave Ehrlich Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 04 Aug 2014
				<BR><BR>

						Dave Ehrlich (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Aarrggghhh" target="_blank">@Aarrggghhh</a>) is the weird guy at the office who plays death metal shows in <a href="https://cadavericspasm.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Cadaveric Spasm</a> on the weekend and tweets nonsensically for his own amusement. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		When I was in high school I was getting really involved with the school radio station, which was a little strange because I really didn’t even listen to music at the time except maybe some <strong>Weird Al</strong> or whatever my nerd friends and I thought was funny to put on while we were rescuing princesses and slaying aliens in our parents basements. I had to do a 30 minute broadcasting project on my favorite band, which I didn’t have. I think I kind of liked whatever <strong>Offspring</strong> album everybody was listening to at the time but it really didn’t thrill me enough to talk about the history of The Offspring for a half hour, which to this day I sometimes look back on as my missed rocket to broadcasting superstardom. 
<BR><BR>
		My lunch room buddy, Eric suggested I check out these guys called <strong>Metallica</strong>. I think I was mostly apathetic to the suggestion but whatever, I ended up picking up ‘Ride the Lightning’ because I really didn’t have any better ideas anyway. That was 15 years ago, to this day as soon as “Fight Fire with Fire” kicks in I start driving faster and hating everyone with the audacity to play any top 40 B.S. with their windows down. There are children around for Christ’s sake, they don’t need to hear that when there’s good, wholesome metal for them to grow up to!
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Remember that Rodney Dangerfield movie 'Back to School?' There’s a scene with kick ass teenage freak out party that Rod throws because he’s rich as hell, but his son is all mopey and emo the whole time so Robert Downey Jr. tries to cheer him up, but just winds up the new spokesman for birth control. 
<BR><BR>
		Being the 80’s it’s kind of hard to find a band to rock your house party who doesn’t bring a truckload of synth’s to complement their neon hi-tops, but that’s cool, beer will make it ok. Well in this case that band was <strong>Oingo Boingo</strong>, whose lead vocalist, Danny you may recognize as the orchestrator of every movie score ever. They’re singing a jaunty tune called ‘Dead Man’s Party’ from an album of the same name which seriously, if you’ve never checked it out then put down the tax return or whatever you’re doing and go listen to it, right now.
<BR><BR>
		I know this album might be a little out of character for me, especially considering the previously impassioned anti top 40 rant above, but dude, Oingo! It’s catchy and maybe, just a little heavy maybe? Maybe not, but from top to bottom it’s a party album. Put it on you’ll rock out, and probably dance and if you don’t dance then you’re no friend of mine! I also really enjoy <strong>Manowar</strong> so I’ve suffered through many comments about furry man panties.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		So many! Here’s just a few that are on my playlist today.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>I Am Heresy</strong>, 'Thy Will' - These guys are absolutely brilliant. Their debut album was really cool but ‘Thy Will’ is a masterpiece. If you want a really great sing along album that will make you at one with the dark lord Satan, look no further!
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Retox</strong>, 'YPLL' - I can’t write enough about how much I love this alum and everything else they’ve done. This is one of those bands that makes you forget that you’re some semblance of a responsible adult, I got to see them in a converted mortuary and it was one of my favorite shows of all time. I’m already a huge fan of <strong>The Locust</strong> and, ok maybe I have a bit of a man crush on Justin Pearson, so I check out every band on Three One G, but this is a really, really solid punk, or metal, or post-something. Whatever, it’s a pissed off album for people who like pissed off music that’s perfectly crafted without resting comfortably in any monotonous genre mold.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Hivesmasher</strong>, 'Gutter Choir' - This is a must listen for anybody who has ever enjoyed the musical styling we call grindcore. These guys have been one of my favorite bands on the planet since I saw them in some basement in New York one fateful CMJ and they have never, ever let me down with a single album release or live show.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Clit Eastwood</strong>, 'S/T' - My good buddy and bandmate Brian discovered <a href="http://cliteastwood512.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Clit Eastwood</a> on the world wide interweb and very quickly our bands became good internet buddies. If early <strong>Napalm Death</strong> had a sense of humor, or if an undiscovered note book full of <strong>Frank Zappa’s</strong> unused lyrics ended up in the hands of a power violence band from Austin, TX, than Clit Eastwood would be the result.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Fuck the Facts</strong>, 'Die Misrible' - Fuck the Facts is one of those bands who are probably incapable of writing a bad album. If they tried to suck the result would be a somehow totally listenable mess of noise and every date of the supporting tour would be sold out in a week.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Listen, I love <strong>Judas Priest</strong>. Every Guitar World top billion guitar solos ever list that doesn’t  include “Painkiller” (hint: none of them include “Paikiller”) sends me into a fit of rage that MTV could film and market as a spoiled 16 year old kid who didn’t get his way for all the world to laugh at. 
<BR><BR>
		That being said, I just picked up ‘Screaming for Vengeance’ for the first time, FINALLY! Not that I wasn’t already familiar with every track anyway, but my stubbornness to not download albums just to have them on my iPod kept this album out of my collection until I came across a copy at the Princeton Record exchange mere months ago and felt really, really stupid for not owning it already.

				<strong>What&#039;s Kara San Joaquin Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Tue, 29 Jul 2014<BR><BR>

		Kara San Joaquin (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/asdfghjkara" target="_blank">@asdfghjkara</a>) is nurse practitioner grad student in Nashville, TN who loves concerts and traveling. Stoked to have Kara featured here! 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		'Colors' by <strong>Between the Buried and Me</strong>. As soon as the opening piano chords ring out, I’m on the edge of my seat waiting for those synth arpeggios to kick in. From there I’m hurtling through time and space for an hour. This is THE album that convinced me to start exploring all things metal or -core. 
<BR><BR>
		My taste lurks mostly in the realm of metalcore (and offshoots) with scream vocals, which were definitely an acquired taste. Even now I find myself laughing at certain styles. Y’know - <strong>Crimson Armada</strong>, <strong>Enfold Darkness</strong>; all I hear is Blue Laser from Cheat Commandos. BUT. During my first listen to 'Colors' I barely flinched at Tommy Rogers’ (unique? ridiculously awesome?) vocals. I was too entranced by the music to laugh or do anything but digest every bit of sonic texture assaulting my ears. I gravitate towards chaotic songwriting, and uh, that’s this band’s middle name. Those dudes are talented as all get out. Their musicianship twists my brain into tangled knots. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing them play live - mental explosions every time!
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		My taste includes a little something for music snobs of all flavors to ridicule, but that doesn’t bother me. I even ridicule my own favorites. Whatever, it’s funny. But when I’m deciding what I like, I’m not worried about cool factor. I’m listening for something that grabs me. Incidentally, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten, “you’re listening to that angry music again!” Ridicule is rampant, so screw it and listen to what you want.
<BR><BR>
		For this discussion, I’m whipping out the “I was a pop punk kid” card. If you cut me, I bleed <strong>Blink-182’s</strong> 'Enema of the State.' Back in the day I knew <strong>Alkaline Trio’s</strong> 'From Here to Infirmary' like the back of my hand and saved up all my pennies for <strong>Midtown’s</strong> 'Living Well is the Best Revenge.' Where did teen me get all my music, Hot Topic? Zing.
<BR><BR>
		Hell, now I’m a pop punk granny. December 2012 found me at the Chicago House of Blues watching <strong>The Starting Line</strong> playing 'Say It Like You Mean It' from start to finish to celebrate the album’s ten year anniversary. I ate up every second of it. Ridicule? Let’s talk about the old farts flailing and pogoing then collapsing to catch their breath between songs. I had a terrifying realization that there really IS such a thing as pit etiquette - most of the crowd obviously hadn’t been to a show since the glory days and did NOT know what they were doing. I was more afraid of getting hurt there than I’ve ever been watching <strong>The Chariot</strong>!
<BR><BR>
		I’m not ashamed to admit I sang every word at the top of my lungs because “we got older but we’re still young, we never grew out of this feeling that we won’t give up.” (Credit Kenny Vasoli.)
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		It is impossible to answer this question with one album only.
<BR><BR>
		'The Discovery,' <strong>Born of Osiris</strong>. (Also known as “Recreate” fifty times on repeat instead.) This album led me to djent, which makes my chug-loving heart cackle with glee.
<BR><BR>
		'The Big Dirty,' <strong>Every Time I Die</strong>. I consider this the Holy Grail of ETID’s catalogue. Again, with my love for chaos. I also have a lot of admiration for the literary references Keith Buckley weaves into his lyrics.
<BR><BR>
		'Haunt What’s Left,' <strong>This or the Apocalypse</strong>. This band is hard working, extremely talented, and to my utter dismay, completely underrated. I found this album after their vocalist posted a picture of his corgi on reddit. Thanks, internet!
<BR><BR>
		'Dead Throne,' <strong>The Devil Wears Prada</strong>. I used to write this band off as a crappy scene band because... well, they were. Then this masterpiece came out of nowhere. It’s the first and last Prada album I’ve ever loved.
<BR><BR>
		'Cerce,' <strong>Cerce</strong>. Hardcore not metal, but worthy of mention. Let me underscore the fact that this band was in high school when they recorded this. I am equal parts impressed and jealous.
<BR><BR>
		My list could go on for eons because a good 80% of my day involves music in some form, but I’ll stop there.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		This is an area where my knowledge is sadly lacking. I started with metalcore and have worked my way out from there, instead of having any sort of roots in heavy metal. I’ve tried to close my knowledge gap by asking for recommendations and seeing what sticks (<strong>Metallica’s</strong> '...and Justice For All,' not so much). 
<BR><BR>
		I once talked music with a self-proclaimed speed metal fan, who I insisted on swapping recs with after he said he thought <strong>Bullet For My Valentine</strong> counted as metalcore. Nooo. One of his trades was <strong>Slayer’s</strong>, 'Reign in Blood,' which was good, but I hesitate to say that I loved it. I’m still sifting through the classics for something that clicks with me.
<BR><BR>
		Progressive rock is probably the closest I can get to classic metal. Take <strong>Queen</strong>, who had a smattering of heavy metal influence in their sound in the mid-70’s (so sayeth Map of Metal, anyway.) Right before my pop punk phase, I was obsessed with 'A Night at the Opera.' Prior to it, I’d never heard any rock that was so potently theatrical. It wasn’t too long before I was picking out 'Death on Two Legs' on the piano and headbanging while playing air guitar to 'Bohemian Rhapsody.' I listened to a lot of rock from the 60’s and 70’s back then, and delighted in gritty guitar riffs that never seemed to last quite as long as I wanted them to. I guess it makes sense that I eventually dug my way into the harder stuff I listen to now.

		<strong>What&#039;s Laura Ansill Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 11 Aug 2014<BR><BR>

		Laura Ansill (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/LauraAnvil">@LauraAnvil</a>, <a href="http://lauraanvil.tumblr.com" target="_blank">tumblr</a>) is a 5th year undergrad student studying ethnomusicology and music journalism at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. She's working on a thesis "about the local hardcore scene in the suburb in which I grew up, about an hour outside of Philadelphia, PA."

<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		'Acquiring the Taste' by <strong>Gentle Giant</strong>. My cousin, a big prog rock fan, introduced me to the record a long time ago and it took me a while to actually get the record for myself, but it was something I sought out a lot as a kid. 
<BR><BR>
		Now that I have it I listen to it constantly, it’s really a fantastic album and I’m sure had a big influence on more prog-y metal bands today, even though Gentle Giant isn’t exactly a metal band themselves. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		'Night Songs' by <strong>Cinderella</strong>. People just assume that because it’s Cinderella it’s going to be a cheesy hair metal record, and... it sort of is, but also it’s insanely doom-y, especially the title track. If you can listen to that song without banging your head a bit, I’ll let you punch me in the face.
<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong> 
<BR><BR>
		'Monoliths and Dimensions' by <strong>Sunn O)))</strong>. It came out right as I was discovering the band, and drone in general, and I got to see them tour with that record at the chapel of the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia (with <strong>Eagle Twin</strong> opening) and it just completely changed my life. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		It’s more than just one album, but early <strong>Metallica</strong>. I was born in 1992, so my introduction to Metallica was through their self-titled / Black Album, and I just naturally assumed that the rest of their stuff was like that, especially once stuff like 'St Anger' came out. This past year though someone finally showed me their earlier stuff, 'Kill 'Em All,' and 'Ride the Lightning' and I was totally blown away!

		<strong>What&#039;s Daniel Marsicano Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 18 Aug 2014<BR><BR>

		Daniel Marsicano (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/DanMarsicano" target="_blank">@heavytothebone2</a>) is a writer and editor living in New Jersey. He's a reviewer for About.com Heavy Metal and Lambgoat, and still finds time to work on his first novel. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		The obvious choice would be something from <strong>Black Sabbath</strong>, <strong>Metallica</strong>, or <strong>Fates Warning</strong> (if we’re getting all prog nerd on this question). My answer though is <strong>Angel Witch’s</strong> eponymous debut. 
<BR><BR>
		I randomly bought this a few years back on iTunes, trying to get my hands on more New Wave of British Heavy Metal albums after realizing my disappointing lack of knowledge in the field. Everybody I talked to told me of its greatness, but I didn’t think anything of it until the band’s defining anthem blared out of my compact, cheap speakers and I knew I found a new love.
<BR><BR>
		The title track alone is enough to get me to throw everything off my desk, jump on top of it, and start air-guitaring until my arms go limp. If I was going to make a list of the best openers of any metal album ever, 'Angel Witch' would be on it without a doubt. It has everything a metal song should possess: killer lead guitar, a section a live crowd can clap along to, thumping rhythm, and a chorus that has to be screamed out in public to unsuspecting people to get the full effect across.
<BR><BR>
		The other songs almost lives up to that track, though it’s like if Iron Maiden had started their first album with "Phantom of the Opera" and dared the rest of the album to try to follow that masterpiece. I love the bass line chugging through 'Confused,' the fierce guitar solo at the end of the otherwise-subdued 'Sorceress,' the evil joy of 'Angel of Death,' and the underwater adventure 'Atlantis.' Don't even ask me to pick my favorite song, as that topic is best saved for a conversation that could go on for at least half-an-hour.
<BR><BR>
		This is, in my opinion, the best NWOBHM album released during its peak. Yep, better than <strong>Def Leppard's</strong> 'On Through The Night' and even tops <strong>Diamond Head's</strong> 'Lightning to the Nations.' This is a youthful, rough metal album that gets by on its energy, even during lesser moments (mostly from guitarist Kevin Heybourne’s cracking vocals). It's a shame that Angel Witch failed to capitalize on this album, with two more albums of varying quality before having a nice comeback with 2012's 'As Above, So Below.'
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Though I write about metal, that's not all I listen to. Metal has been a constant presence in my life since I was 11, but I can't just listen to it all day. Sometimes, a man needs to put on <strong>Meat Loaf's</strong> 'Bat Out of Hell' and sing along to every word (which I can do, by the way). I’m also a sucker for disco music, which would have gotten my ass kicked back in the late '70s if I proclaimed that (hell, if I told my 15 year old self that, he would have kicked my ass). Over the past year or so, I’ve fallen hard for <strong>Abba</strong>, and not just the singles. I’m talking the deep album cuts like 'The Name of the Game' and 'Tiger,' the ones that didn’t get much airplay on the radio.
<BR><BR>
		So I could literally pick any of the Abba albums and I think it would fit this question, but the one that has gotten stuck in constant rotation has to be 'The Album.' You got the classic 'Take A Chance On Me,' the grandiose opener 'Eagle,' and the mini-musical that made up the last three tracks. There's a bit of a darker edge to the music, which I think was further elaborated on later in their career with 'The Visitors,' also a fantastic album. If you catch me in a vulnerable moment, you could probably hear me singing 'I Wonder (Departure)' out loud to no one in particular. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past 5 years that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		When I was going through a rough patch in my life after graduating college, I turned to <strong>Woods of Ypres'</strong> 'Woods 4: The Green Album' for support. It’s a raw, emotional declaration of lost love and deep regret; all things I was going through at the time. I had no way to express these feelings, so I let this album do the expressing for me. The way David Gold sung and screamed his heart out about pain and misfortune and how he dealt with it all resonated with me. His lyrics were so direct, upfront with the emotional outpouring, that I could relate to almost every word he uttered. There wasn’t any digging for hours to get the meaning behind the songs, as whatever was meant to be said was right there for the world to hear. 
<BR><BR>
		It's not the easiest album to absorb, its almost 80 minutes never letting up on the bleakness dripping from every second. Though Woods of Ypres were known for chilly black metal that mixed in keyboards and moodier atmospheres, The Green Album was where Gold pushed into more of a doom-y tempo along with the black metal. His melodic vocals were also on display in a greater capacity, and his Peter Steele-ish delivery was exquisite. '...And I Am Pining (For You)' and 'I Was Buried In Mount Pleasant Cemetery' are some of the saddest songs Gold has written, though there's also a beautiful gem found with the acoustic-only 'You Are Here With Me (In This Sequence Of Dreams).' 
<BR><BR>
		You would think listening to this album after five years would leave some kind of scar on me, a constant reminder of the darker periods of my life. Instead, it gives me resolve to be a better person, someone who can fight past these hateful, negative vibes and find the bright spot in even the most despairing moments. I think the best kind of music, even ones with imperfections like this album, evokes these kind of reactions from a listener. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		I was a big thrash metal fan when I was a teen, using <strong>Metallica</strong>, <strong>Megadeth</strong>, <strong>Flotsam & Jetsam</strong>, and <strong>Heathen</strong> to satisfy my lust for the genre. As time went on, I began to branch out and try to get my hand on anything I could find. One of those bands was <strong>Exodus</strong>, but my introduction to them was 2004's 'Tempo of the Damned.' It's a great album, no doubt, but I never bothered to go back through their catalog. Then I was stuck in the Rob Dukes era for a while before picking up 'Fabulous Disaster.' I knew that I had to go even further back, but it took me until early 2014 to give Exodus' first album 'Bonded by Blood' a listen. Obviously, I feel like an idiot for waiting so long to experience such a classic debut.
<BR><BR>
		Listening to this brought me back to the first time I heard Metallica's 'Kill 'em All' as a acne-ridden teenager. I had never heard anything as aggressive or reckless before, and 'Bonded by Blood' has the same aura around it. Other than the acoustic intro to 'No Love,' Exodus does not back down with their thrash attack and it's something that has held up after all these decades. Many albums can lose their charm as the years wear on, but Bonded by Blood is no such victim of that circumstance. In another ten years, this album will still be as memorable and I will love it just as much.

						Sarah B. Koenig (pronounced Kay-Nig) (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/SarahBKoenig" target="_blank">@Sarahbellzz</a>) is from Brooklyn, NY (accent and all), a music connoisseur, teen-mom turned adult by default 12 ½ years ago, coffee drinker, Finnish speaker, and bad-ass chick. Check out her site <a href="http://www.cherrychinchilla.com" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		I have the attention span of a fruit fly, and what I like to call 'Music Schizophrenia' so it's never just 1 album that I listen to, but I have to say; <strong>Type O Negative</strong>, 'October Rust'. I have so much personal history with that album, I'll leave it at that. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Clutch</strong>, 'The Elephant Riders,' has to be a big one. I've loved Clutch since the very beginning, like, their KFC every sunday days. I saw them in 1998, at an old club that used to be the Mecca of NYC/Underground metal (Post L'amours, which I'm too young to have gone to the original before it closed), called 'Coney Island High', and it was and still is TO THIS DAY the loudest show I have ever been to. In fact, I lost an octave of hearing in my right ear at that show, but they were hypnotic and still are to me. 
<BR><BR>
		'Elephant Riders,' changed me, made me go back and explore a lot of funk and blues because I had never heard it fused together like that, and with Neil Fallon's smooth delivery, it was a blend for a skilled ear, and I understood it.  
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		The <strong>Devin Townsend Project's</strong> 'Addicted' because he is a fucking musical genius, and that album is so phenomenally prolific, that you can't help but physically cry and ultimately get a somewhat therapeutic response of mental clarity afterwards. 
<BR><BR>
		And this unbelievably phenomenal band from Finland called <strong>Lapko</strong>. I'm extremely into Scandinavian metal, and I hate to categorize by sub-genres, but Lapko is one of those bands that made me go backwards and finally give <strong>Rush</strong> a chance, as crazy as it sounds, that's the element of surprise I love about music. 
<BR><BR>
		I had heard their song 'River Venom' on a web stream of RadioFinland, and I thought it was a new Rush song, and I ended up opening my Shazam app to double check, because I wanted MORE, and was shocked when it came up as a band called Lapko. Their entire catalogue is phenomenal, and I listen to their 2009 'New Bohemia' album at least once a week. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Rush</strong> '2112'. Rush is one of those bands that You refrain from calling 'Metal' but people fail to realize, their very first major tour, was with <strong>Kiss</strong>. 
<BR><BR>
		'2112 Overture/The Temples of Syrinx is one of the most HEAVY FUCKING METAL songs ever recorded, hands down. They are also a band that I'm late to the game with, and I'm pretty sure it has to do with maturity, but to me, They have no bad albums. So yes, I am technically one of the handfuls of women out there, who would actually be at a Rush show, To see The band! (which I hope and wish for more than anything in this world, is to see Rush live).

She loves to read, write on her blog <a href="https://heavymetalduchess.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Heavy Metal Duchess</a>, travel, collect vintage pieces and discuss music. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I don't know who introduced me to <strong>Dimmu Borgir</strong> or why they did so but 'Enthrone Darkness Triumphant' still gives me the chills. It was Dimmu Borgir's first release with Nuclear Blast records and it was the first release from the band to contain English lyrics. Everything about that album is fantastic – from the orchestral nuances to the dark imagery. 
<BR><BR>
		The other album that makes me stop and listen is 'CVI' by <strong>Royal Thunder</strong>. I came across the band while having to review their album for a music zine about two years ago.  After being roped in by Miny Parsonz' voice, I went out and got a physical copy of the album. 'CVI' is literally glued to my car's CD player. To me that album goes with my every mood, story, tear and smile. That's real music right there. 
<BR><BR>
		Of course, <strong>Black Sabbath's</strong> 'Between Heaven and Hell' gets a mention. I mean, in 1975 the foundation for heavy metal was being placed. Those are good chills.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Oh Sure! <strong>Madonna's</strong> True Blue' is one of them. My mother had the cassette tape and collected a few posters of the old-school Queen of Pop. 
<BR><BR>
		I was around five years old when I pushed play on the 'True Blue' cassette and around 16 years old when I bought the reissued collection. I do remember being furious when Kelly Osbourne sang 'Papa don't preach.' Kelly should just stick to her day job of being Ozzy's daughter.
<BR><BR>
		On a heavier note, 'Load' by <strong>Metallica</strong> is a winner with me. I even got it on reissued vinyl.  
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		That is a tough one. Here are four that I can think of right now.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Arrayan Path's</strong> 'Ira Imperium' gets a lot of play according to my iTunes stats.  Thanks to @RockCyprus and friends for sending me stuff from the band! It's just feel good epic power metal. 
<BR><BR>
		The 'Living with the Ancients' album from <strong>Blood Ceremony</strong> ranks high on my iTunes stats, too. It's their pagan-inspired lyrics that really grab me.  Also, their sound embodies all my favourites from Black Sabbath to <strong>Electric Wizard</strong>. 
<BR><BR>
		The Finnish scene is always close to my ears. I did an interview with <strong>Moonsorrow</strong> a few months back and in order to prepare for it, I went through their entire discography. It definitely resurrected my interest in their music specifically with 'Varjoina kuljemme kuolleiden maassa.'
<BR><BR>
		As I'm writing this, 'The return to darkness' by <strong>Demonic Resurrection</strong> is playing. This album would be my first introduction to the Indian metal band. I remember learning more about them through Sam Dunn's documentaries. I definitely referred many people to this band and I'm sure it got a lot of play in the past fives years. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you love it?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Judas Priest's</strong> 'British Steel!' The local record store in our town had a clearance sale. As soon as I saw Judas Priest, I bought it. Now I understand what the hype is actually all about. 'British Steel' and 'Angel of Retribution' accompany me on long bus commutes.

			<strong>What&#039;s Brian Flannery Listening To?</strong><BR>
				Mon, 15 Sep 2014
				<BR><BR>


						Brian Flannery (@xpenis_cakesx) is born and raised in Northeast Philadelphia. He works at a college and plays in <a href="http://cadavericspasm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Cadaveric Spasm</a>.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		Without a doubt, it's <strong>Snapcase</strong>, 'Progression Through Unlearning.' 
<BR><BR>
		I was probably 16 when it came out and I was all sorts of long haired hesher, listening to nothing but <strong>Metallica</strong>, <strong>Slayer</strong>, and <strong>Pantera</strong>. My friend Christian, who exposed me to a lot of underground hardcore and metal, put on Snapcase while grinning ear to ear and saying, "check this out". This is one of those rare “totally perfect all the way through” albums and my first exposure to hardcore. 
<BR><BR>
		I remember wanting more of this, so I checked out other bands like <strong>Vision of Disorder</strong>, <strong>Downset</strong>, <strong>Disembodied</strong>, <strong>Harvest</strong>, and <strong>Earth Crisis</strong>. Also, to every drummer I was in the band with, if you are reading this, this album is why I told you to buy a piccolo snare!
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		I feel like <strong>Depeche Mode</strong> (who I adore and know every word to their songs, test me) is too cliché to say but I’ve been listening to a lot of singer-songwriters like <strong>Mindy Smith</strong> and <strong>Alela Diane</strong>. 'To Be Still' by Alela Diane is a great starting point for anyone interested, as well as 'One More Moment' for Mindy.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong>
<BR><BR>
		<strong>East of the Wall</strong>, 'Ressentiment.' I'm not much of a “technical metal” kind of guy. I honestly find it very boring and masturbatory. I just imagine those bands just sit in their practice space and think “how many riffs can I fit into this seven minute song without an ounce of melody?” Thankfully, East of the Wall aren't those dudes. 
<BR><BR>
		I played a show with these guys a year or so at Kung Fu Necktie and was legit blown away by them. They are technical without the jerking off and they know how to write a really really good song or 12. Also, some of the nicest dudes I ever played with.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Tomahawk</strong>, 'Oddfellows'
		Tomahawk has a great pedigree of musicians that were all from heavier acts at one point. They just embrace that musical weirdness that easily could have been used for a Twin Peaks soundtrack.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>The Drip</strong>, 'The Wasteland'
		These guys are that new school “lets crank our HM-2 pedals to 10” <strong>Entombed</strong>-style grindcore that everyone is loving lately, including me. I just heard their new album through Relapse but I keep gravitating back to 'The Wasteland.'
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Buried At Birth</strong>, 'Pestilent Hallucinations'
		A great grind band from San Jose, CA. They remind me if early <strong>Napalm Death</strong> convinced Mia Zapata from <strong>The Gits</strong> to start screaming from them. If I had a basement, I'd want them to play it.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>St. Paul and The Broken Bones</strong>, 'Half The City'
		Here is my dark horse album, folks. I can't give this album enough love without rambling. Seriously. They are just simply an amazing soul band from Alabama. Definitely reminds me of my childhood, growing up to Chicago, <strong>Hall and Oates</strong>, and other bands of that ilk coming out of my moms tape deck.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Woods of Ypres</strong>, 'V'
		I would’ve included this album in my “this gives me the chills” but I decided to leave this here. I'm sure you can say this about a lot of doom style bands where every album sounds like its the singers epitaph but this one really strikes that chord, plus it really was David Golds' epitaph album. 'Kiss My Ashes Goodbye' seems like the perfect song for someone on his or her death bed. Lyrically, it's very humble in that, he doesn't want any monuments to his life because it really doesn't matter in the end. Still, its a shame we'll never hear these songs live.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal (or any other genre) album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		This question is really hard for me to answer because I was raised on a lot classic metal by my brother and there really wasn't anything that got by me, especially in my teens. I tend to be a music sponge. I feel like if I had to choose, it would be <strong>Queensryche</strong>, 'Operation Mindcrime.' 

<BR><BR>
		Maybe once every couple of months, I go back to that album and remember how awesome it is. This album is still as strong as it was in 1988 and I think thats due to Queensryche were always more cerebral than their peers. How many times can you write a song about getting laid or that same boohoo my girlfriend dumped me bullshit? Queensryche saw through that, instead looking what is around them and wrote how fucked we were as a society. Trust me, that was some heavy stuff to realize at eight years old!

		<strong>What&#039;s Kevin Dillon Listening To?</strong><BR>
		Mon, 06 Oct 2014
		<BR><BR>

				Kevin Dillon (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/kevdillon316" target="_blank">@kevdillon316</a>) is a husband, father, <a href="http://www.smallscreensaver.blogspot.ie" target="_blank">movie/music blogger</a>, and long time metal fan. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong> 
<BR><BR>
		'Slaughter of the Soul' by <strong>At The Gates</strong> still blows me away. Structured perfectly, I never get tired of listening to it nor do I ever skip any tracks on it. When that first riff kicks in for "Blinded By Fear" it kicks my ass, every time. 
<BR><BR>
		The first Mastodon record, 'Remission,' is still their strongest in my opinion. I know this could get me some hate, but I'm not a fan of the post 'Crack The Skye' direction. People say, "well bands change and mature etc. etc." which is fine. I get that bands have to develop or they end up stagnant but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Honorable mentions for the first System of a Down album, and Fantomas' 'The Directors Cut' which is for me the best non FNM Mike Patton record. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		I wouldn't say it's ridiculed, but Pantera's 'Great Southern Trendkill' is overlooked and unappreciated. 'Vulgar Display of Power' is great, but it seems like just a collection of really cool riffs, whereas the songs on 'Trendkill' have a lot more going on. Plus, the solo in 'Floods' is the best thing Dime ever committed to tape. 
<BR><BR>
		I'll also stick my neck out and nail my colors to the mast for 'St. Anger.' Totally undeserving of the abuse it gets (well, apart from 'Invisible Kid'). I love how raw it is, and how it flies in the face of anything they ever did before. Sure, 'Death Magnetic' had the old school Metallica sound and structure, but lyrically I find it uninteresting, unlike 'St. Anger' where you get Hetfield spilling his guts. 
<BR><BR>
		With non metal music, I have a deep seeded love for 80's radio hits that I'll never grow out of, probably because I grew up with them. If singing along with Men at Work's "Down Under" is wrong, I don't want to be right.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>What's something from the past five years (going back to 2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong></strong> 
<BR><BR>
		'Abrahadabra' by <strong>Dimmu Borgir</strong> is one I listen to at least once a week. Not a weak track on it, and I love the over the top nature of some of it. 
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Viza</strong> have put out three really good albums since 2010, 'Made in Chernobyl,' 'Carnivalia' and 'Aria.' <strong>Whitechapel's</strong> self titled album from 2012 is a beast. 
<BR><BR>
		In terms of non metal stuff, the <strong>Tom Waits</strong> live album 'Glitter and Doom' is incredible. He could have gone out and just sang the songs with some crowd noise in the breaks, but changing the arrangements for some of the songs was just inspired and makes them different enough from the original recorded versions that you don't mind having both on your preferred listening device. Finally, to big up the Irish contingent, <strong>Val Normal</strong> released a killer grunge/prog album early 2013 called 'Plans? What Plans?' that's definitely worth a listen.

		<Strong>What's Curtis Dewar Listening To?</strong><BR>
Oct 20, 2014
<BR><BR>

		<strong>What album still gives you the chills after all these years?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		 This is actually a tough question for me as there are a few. However,  Stryper's 'To Hell With the Devil' introduced me to metal when I was 10 years old and after that I listened to nothing but metal for years. Every time I hear it I get goose bumps.  After hearing Stryper I binged on nothing but metal. Pop was totally dead to me. 
<BR><BR>
		 A couple of years after hearing Stryper I came across a cassette of Megadeth's 'So Far, So Good... So What!!' and as a result I got hooked on heavier stuff. It's not my favorite Megadeth album, but it still means a lot to me as it was my first foray into more extreme metal. 
<BR><BR>

		 <strong>Is there an album that you enjoy that is typically ridiculed?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		 Yep there are a few  but the one I'll pick is  'Under the Pink' by Tori Amos:
<BR><BR>
		 This one gets a few eyebrow raises from metal people when I mention this album and I'm kind of suprised I got into it as much as I did. I first heard Tori in 1994 or 1995 when I was totally into death metal. I was flipping through the channels and decided to see if there was anything interesting on Much Music (Canada's equivalent of MTV). There was a special about Tori and somehow I got hooked.The following day I drove 45 minutes to the closest record store and purchased both 'Under the Pink' and 'Little Earthquakes.' I've loved all of Tori's stuff ever since then.
<BR><BR>
		She may not be metal but her music is quite dark. A lot of her song actually have a lot of metal themes when you think about it. For example she sings about the devil (Father Lucifer), blasphemy (God), homicidal thoughts (Waitress), death (Happy Phantom). She  even did a cover of 'Raining Blood!'
<BR><BR>

		<strong>What's something from the past five years (going back to 2009) that you're still Listening To?</strong>
<BR><BR>
		Lots of stuff. But "Into the Kingdom of Graves" by Tyrants Blood is an album that I keep going back to. I first found out about them in Jan 2013 when I saw them open for Weapon in Vancouver Canada. To say I was stunned by their performance was an understatment. They play chaotic music that sounds like a cross between death and thrash metal.  When they released 'Into the Kingdom of Graves' later that year I absolutely loved it. I was  then fortunate enough to work publicity for the album and get to know the band. It's always cool to be able to work with a band that you're a big fan of and hopefully I'll get to work with them in the future too.
<BR><BR>
		<strong>Is there a "classic" metal album you never listened to, but you finally did and you LOVE IT? </strong>
<BR><BR>
		Yep, for years I didn't bother listening to the Dio era Black Sabbath. When I finally did I was completely blown away. I now consider the Dio era stuff to be just as good as, if not better than the Ozzy era Sabbath.<BR><BR>
